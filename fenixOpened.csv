"['feature request 🌟', 'pin']",Instrument the automation pipeline via Amplitude,"Main assumption behind this effort (and issues like #1273) is that poor performance of the automation pipeline is a source of friction in the day-to-day life of developers. Our CI systems should aid developers, not hinder them. Given that we're dealing with a fairly complex system that involves many different moving parts and a wide configuration space, instrumenting it becomes necessary to succeed in both _making_ and _keeping_ it fast and reliable.

One way to approach this is to schedule an additional task as part of our PR/whatever pushes that will run once all tasks in the group are resolved. This task will gather runtime statistics for all of the scheduled tasks (module tasks, decision task, etc), annotate them with relevant meta data (which worker-type task ran on, what kind of task it is, result type, etc), and send that off to Amplitutde.

Once the data is in Amplitude, we should be able to create dashboards, deep dive into data, create alerts, graphs, etc. Amplitude is a powerful analytics tool that is getting a wide adoption at Mozilla. It should be a really good fit here.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Gesture', 'pin']",[Meta] Gestures,"We want to support the following gestures: 

**Long press to select and reveal actions**
Works on cards, list items and web content, for example

* [x] long press on tab on home to enter selection mode (implemented)
* [x] long press on bookmark item to enter selection mode (implemented)
* [x] long press on history item to enter selection mode (implemented)
* [x] long press on text, images, links to get additional actions (context menu) (implemented)

**Long press to quickly navigate to a view**
Works on selected UI icons to get quicker to a view, for example

* [x] long press on multi-select icon to open a new tab (P2) (implemented)
* [x] long press on back/forward navigation arrow in menu to open a tabs history (P3, #1048 )
* [x] long press on site lock to open Site permissions in settings (P3)

**Pull to refresh**

* [x] https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/3262
* [ ] https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/9766
Works on views that can update content, for example
* [ ] pull down on a site to refresh the content (P1)
* [x] pull down on bookmarks to start sync (P2, #2165) (implemented)
* [x] pull down on history to start sync (P2, #2165) (implemented)

**Swipe left/right to delete**
Works on cards and list items, for example

* [x] swipe left/right on a card/tab on home to delete (implemented)
* [x] swipe left/right on a bookmark entry to delete (P3, #12551)
* [ ] swipe left/right on a history entry to delete (P3, #12610)
When people start swiping on a card or list item, the action is revealed and people can either pull through to delete or stop and keep the item.

**Swipe left/right to navigate**

* [ ] swipe left/right on site to go backward/forward in tab history (P2, #12327)
* [x] swipe left/right on browser URL bar to go to previous/next open tab (P2) https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/3481
* [ ] consider swipe up/down (depending on bottom or top app bar) to view tab tray / home (#11862)

- I can retrieve my saved pages from within the browser

I would frequently save to PDF directly from reader mode in order to focus on the text and image content I cared about.\r\n\r\nI realize my use case is probably more niche than most, but the Fenix update has hampered this workflow and introduced additional friction by forcing me to go back to Chrome whenever I need to save content offline.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Battery']",Enable Battery Saver settings,"This is about packaging existing features that help users save battery.

### User Story
As a user, I want to be able to enable battery saver mode in my browser, so I can browse for longer without having to charge my phone. 

### Requirements
Surface a battery saver mode that includes the following battery saving features:
-Block Trackers
-Disable media autoplay
-Enable dark theme
-Enable dark mode (webpage)
-Auto Reader Mode (when available)
Later:
-Lower Image Quality
-Throttle Streaming Bandwidth (use lower quality video streams)

### Acceptance Criteria
* I can enable battery saving mode (enabling all features)
* I can individually toggle off each feature

This is a feature [desired by users](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/argotb/screenshots_of_fenix_build_101907/egntrur/).

Port of [Bug 578179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578179)

>WebKit on Android has an option to wrap text so that lines of text are no wider than the screen width.  This means that text reflows to fit the screen as the user zooms in and out.  The width of block-level elements does not change - the overall layout of the page stays the same, and only the text wrapping is altered.

>We want this option for Fenix, since (a) it makes many web pages much easier to read on small screens, especially in portrait orientation, and (b) we want to convince Android users to switch from the default browser, where many of them rely on this feature.

"['feature request 🌟', 'P3', 'Feature:Search']",Add a paste clipboard link when the contents are text but not a url,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
If I copy a url, open Fenix and tap the search bar, I see a ""Fill link from clipboard"" command. If I copy some other kind of text (e.g. a word or phrase) and then perform the same steps I don't see any command to fill in my clipboard contents. Of course I can still long press the search field to get the paste command but I may be led to believe that Fenix doesn't support this because I don't see fill command. In addition, tapping a fill link is more discoverable and easier to perform than a long press in the search field.

### What / Requirements
When there is text in the clipboard that is not a URL, we should present a similar command. Maybe, ""Fill text from clipboard"" to match the link command. But we should not show the contents of the clipboard in this case (unlike the link case) because it could be very long or contain sensitive information.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
When I have arbitrary text in my clipboard I should see a ""Fill text from clipboard"" link when in search mode.

### Priority
I don't think this is a blocker. This would be nice to have in the MVP.

We need UX direction, basically we need a TTS icon. With that and placement in the UI of #190  we can accept a pull request. In terms of how the feature acts and interacts, I suggest following what we do on desktop.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
Icon
Placement
Okay to follow desktop UX.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Telemetry']",[Telemetry] Add distributionID to baseline ping,"#### Description & Product Manager 
* As a BD manager, I want to know from which distribution partner users installed the app from.

#### What questions will you answer with this data?
* By knowing what partner install the user came from allows us to understand their usage better

#### Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions? Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements?
* Be able to understand from what partner / distro  users came from

#### What probes (suggested, if applicable)
* disributionID, see row 24 in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2_aGEE9OtjM3x71d0GBhnHDhzxEL02xEHuKn1no23E/edit#gid=0

### Dependencies (Added by PM and Eng)
* Core ping / baseline ping

### Acceptance Criteria (Added by PM)
* Baseline pings can be queried via re:dash
* We are sending telemetry events for the actions listed in the requirements
* We have documented the telemetry
* We have asked a data steward to [review](https://github.com/mozilla/data-review/blob/master/request.md) the telemetry
* NOT an AC: Data science to create dashboard or further graphs (this will be a separate issue, this issue is only about hooking up the events described and that they can be queried in re-dash)

['feature request 🌟'],Local file system browsing,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
I want to be able to view HTML documents and other supported files on my phone's local storage (including removable SD cards and such-like) in the browser, like I can with Firefox today.

### What / Requirements
Unfortunately Google plans to make this rather difficult, and if we want to provide this feature on Android Q onwards we'd likely need

1. [content://-URI support in GeckoView](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1516467)
1. Either hoping [that](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/129629193) [these](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/128641684) [objections](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/128591846) succeed, so that real file system access remains possible if the user grants it at least to specific directories, or else GeckoView also needs the ability for accessing files and browsing directories through the Storage Access Framework (which e.g. isn't really written with native code in mind as far as I've heard).
1. Pestering Google about the [fundamental unsuitability of working with content://-URIs received from other apps](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/77406791) when the content in question _isn't_ a single, atomic file, for which HTML documents are a perfect example.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
1. I can browse through the local file system and open supported files.
1. Other apps can launch Intents for files on the local storage that the browser supports and those files are then successfully loaded (in the case of HTML documents that means _including_ all subresources like images, style sheets, etc. and with working local relative links).

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:TextSelection']",Select text from hypertext link,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Currently it's very difficult to select phrases and words that are links. Being able to select this texts is helpful, because having the context menu open with the text selected, allows the user to search the term in the search engine, translate it, save it, etc. Also, no browser besides Samsung Internet allows text selection from links (that I know of), so, adding this feature to Fenix may give it some leverage over it's competitors.

### What / Requirements
When long pressing a link, the context menu shows an option to select text, among the options that are already available.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
It's possible to select text from links.

### Expected behavior
`onTrimMemory` does nothing if Gecko is not already running.

### Actual behavior
`onTrimMemory` is trying to _start_ Gecko in order to trim memory, which is clearly wrong.  As a side effect, it means that Gecko starts with a default profile, 'cuz the `onTrimMemory` call is invoked _before_ the Intent that handles the Intent extras gets to process them.

['feature request 🌟'],Prompt the user before opening a website with an external application,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Firefox users tend to be more privacy conscious, so redirecting them to another app without consent may not be the best behavior. I suggest the Samsung Internet's approach of asking the user before opening any website with an external application (when the corresponding app is installed).

### What / Requirements
A pop-up asking something like ""do you want to open thiswebsite.com with it's external application?"" (In the case thiswebsite.com has an app installed on the device)

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
When touching a YouTube link on Google for example, the user is asked whether they want to open it on Fenix or other app.

It's hassle to go to the top or bottom, or middle, of pages that are long, full of content. It takes too much times swiping your finger up and down until you reach the part of the page that you want.

A scroll bar that allows for quick navigation of long pages, and gets invisible once it's not in use anymore.

"['feature request 🌟', 'P3', 'Feature:AndroidIntegration']","Full-screen mode, AKA hide status bar","### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Increases screen real estate (can display more text/pics, open tabs, bookmarks, etc. Users don't usually need status bar shown while browsing. Especially handy for reading articles--really anything.

User choice! 

https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/17677 also requested support for full immersive mode - both the status bar and the navigation bar to be hidden.

The Android status bar doesn\'t _look_ like it takes up much space, but hiding it really adds an ""immersive"" experience to using the app. The status bar isn\'t really needed while browsing/reading articles/looking at pictures, and it also allows for a little less scrolling and finger strain. But if needed, it temporarily shows if the user swipes down from the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nThis is why I think an option to totally hide it everywhere while using the app would be great.

On reddit I was told to put my opinion here (still not sure if it belongs here, but ok), so I was just trying Fenix on my tablet and as it turns out it uses the same user interface as the one on phones, which I believe doesn't use the much bigger screen of a tablet as well as it could.
Specifically I'm really missing the desktop like tabs layout, which works very well on tablets. Any chance this will change to what it is like now in Firefox Mobile (or Fennec if you prefer)?

['feature request 🌟'],Provide save/restore instance state solution in Fenix architecture,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
When the Android OS evicts Fenix from memory to make space for another app or game, we don't want our users to lose app state.

Let's say a user is browsing in reader mode and then jumps into a video game on a low specs phone. It's not unlikely the state of the browser will be lost when the user returns because the OS will evict our app from memory to make room for the game. By having our architecture save its state into instance state, that state will still be there when the user returns.

### What/Requirements
Essentially, the requirement is to store state to instance state when the app gets evicted.

There is some complexity, however, as we have a hard limit of 1 MB to store and should really store no more than 100 KB. This means the solution chosen will require the programmer to choose which state gets stored.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
If I minimize the app and then stop it from Android Studio, state chosen to be kept by the programmer will be kept when the app is reopened from the Recents screen.

On very long pages (frex <https://www.metafilter.com/180757/To-be-or-not-to-be-ay-theres-the-point>) the  ephemeral scrollbar that appears when scrolling the page and shows the current scroll position on the page is so small that it's almost Invisible.

### What/Requirements
The scrollbar should be scaled based on the length of the page—matching current behavior—with the exception that it never be scaled below some predefined clearly visible size.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
When, while scrolling through even a very long page, you can tell at a glance the current scroll position.

Currently blocking content like ads, share banners, and comment sections, is not possible (completely) on Fenix. This may be fixed in the future by web extensions, but content blockers have advantages over extensions. They are lighter and faster, specially in weak mobile devices (I suppose). There are services made specially for mobile web already available that work with multiple browsers (Samsuns Internet, Yandex Browser, and Safari on iOS). They are easily manageable. I believe that, it may be worth considering.

### What/Requirements

As a low-vision user, it would be nice if there were an easy option in the accessibility settings to force-enable a high-contrast theme for web content, as well as a way for the user to customise what those colours would be.

Desktop Firefox has an option to specify the colours used when a high-contrast theme is active. And this is customisable on Firefox for Android via about:config and can be forced setting the ""browser.display.document_color_use"" preference to ""2"".
Also, since Android doesn't have a native high-contrast theme, there would need to be a setting to enable it without having to know the correct preferences to change or what about:config is

"['eng:build', 'P2', 'needs:investigation', 'performance', 'pin']","Ensure`$ANDROID_NDK_HOME` is set in build environment, to strip native libs by default","Over in https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/1374 I was a bit surprised to find that Fenix was shipping a copy of `libfenix.so` that contained many megabytes of debug symbols, because the android gradle plugin is supposed to strip these debug symbols by default (so much so that the top search result I see for ""android strip native libraries"" is an article on how to _disable_ this stripping!).

Over in [application-services](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/issues/1107#issuecomment-491087035) we eventually discovered that the android-gradle-plugin expects to find the location of the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/) in the `$ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable. Setting this correctly in our build scripts magically enabled stripping of debug symbols and reduced the size of our native library builds quite dramatically.

I suggest checking whether this environment variable is set correctly in the Fenix build environment, and enabling it if so. This could produce a modest size saving by ensuring that any third-party native libs (such as [this one](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/1374#issuecomment-479747655)) have their debug symbols stripped as well.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Toolbar']",Themes (as implemented on Fennec) are extremely limited,"From [Bug 1554028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1554028)

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
The theming capabilities for Firefox for Android only allow for two customizations: an image in the background and the colors/frame attribute (which, I believe, changes the color of the notification bar, but the documentation is unclear). I would like to create a minimalistic theme that looks similar to the (old) Private Browsing persona.

### What/Requirements
The following properties need to be implemented:

* Color of the search bar (colors/toolbar_field)
* Color of search bar text (colors/toolbar_field_text)
* Color of icons next to the search bar (colors/icons) (colors/bookmark_text?)

(It may also be worth considering a specific ""x_fennec"" or ""x_android"" property for each of these to override the desktop version if desired. This would allow theme creators to distribute the same theme for Firefox and Fennec. On that note...)

The image/theme_frame property should not be required. The color/frame property should fill in any space behind the header that is not occupied by a background image, just as it does on desktop Firefox.

Other properties that I would recommend implementing:

* Color of the horizontal lines above the toolbar and icon tray (colors/toolbar_top_seperator) 
* Color and text color of hamburger menu (colors/popup and colors/popup_text, respectively) 

### Acceptance Criteria
Using the above, I should be able to download and use my [Material Gray](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/material-gray-purple/) theme on Fenix. It would have a gray background on the UI elements and white icons/text, and separator lines would disappear/blend in with the other elements. 

Feel free to ask questions.

Additionally, Sync supports queries (which are bookmarks with a special `place:` URL that Desktop parses and renders specially, kind of like a Windows shortcut) and livemarks (which are deprecated).

Let's consider filtering out queries and livemarks in folder lists, since it's a bit confusing to see them, and, unlike Desktop, they don't do anything special.

['feature request 🌟'],Implement about:compat,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
With Firefox's small market share, a lot of sites ignore it and don't play nice with non-Chromium or non-WebKit browsers, meaning Firefox only. This results in breakage the user will blame on the application and Mozilla.

### What/Requirements
Another about: entry to he generated with flags for certain problematic sites (as planned in Firefox 68 on desktop).

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
The about:compat entry can be loaded and flags customized by the user. This feature is set to land in Firefox 68 on the desktop. Since Fenix is currently based off GeckoView 68, work could theoretically be started at the time of writing this.

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Lots of people are using Fenix and would like to see various features added that already exist and they use in Fennec (the current Firefox for Android) - for evidence look at the discussion in the mailing list. I am aware of the GitHub projects which are the product team's technical roadmap but what about a ""simple English"" roadmap for the target audience which explains when existing Fennec features will be added to Fenix? I am making the assumption that this is a goal of the project, but maybe it is not? In which case it would be useful to know which Fennec features are not intended to be added to Fenix. Or maybe some features will be changed when implemented in Fenix? 

### Acceptance Criteria (Added by PM. For EPM to track when a Meta feature is done)
List of Fennec features and when they are planned to be added to Fenix (or if they will not be, state this explicitly). E.g. you can look at the list in my original post in the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/fenix-nightly/99h3O3nuHJU/XacymGcAAwAJ

['feature request 🌟'],Implement Apple Smart Banners and Facebook app-links metadata for better app banners.,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Web developers are rolling their own app banners in order to link out to their installed apps.

Our current strategy of using _just_ the URL and `intent://` schemes may work for intercepting link clicks (not withstanding [a potential security hole][3]).

Web developers are in an arms race to exploit potential security holes in order to detect if their app is installed and redirect the user to it or the market place.

Apple have introduced the concept of [smart app banners][2]. Fennec uses a Droid icon to indicate that an app can be loaded (a [long discussion here][5]).

### What/Requirements
Web developers are already adding Facebook markup to their pages in order to be openable/linkable from [the Facebook app][1] and [Twitter app][4]. This provides app deep links, app packages for both iOS and Android.

FB links from the instagram main page:

```html
<meta property=""al:ios:app_name"" content=""Instagram"" />
<meta property=""al:ios:app_store_id"" content=""389801252"" />
<meta property=""al:ios:url"" content=""instagram://mainfeed"" />
<meta property=""al:android:app_name"" content=""Instagram"" />
<meta property=""al:android:package"" content=""com.instagram.android"" />
<meta property=""al:android:url"" content=""https://www.instagram.com/_n/mainfeed/"" />
```

Twitter card links from the soundcloud page:

```html
<meta content=""SoundCloud"" property=""twitter:site"">
<meta content=""SoundCloud"" property=""twitter:app:name:iphone"">
<meta content=""336353151"" property=""twitter:app:id:iphone"">
<meta content=""SoundCloud"" property=""twitter:app:name:ipad"">
<meta content=""336353151"" property=""twitter:app:id:ipad"">
<meta content=""SoundCloud"" property=""twitter:app:name:googleplay"">
```

Web developers are already [adding Apple markup to their pages][2] in order to indicate that a [Smart App Banner][2].

```html
<meta name=""apple-itunes-app"" content=""app-id=myAppStoreID, affiliate-data=myAffiliateData, app-argument=myURL"">
```

All of these would be findable with either [`fathom-web`][6] or [`page-metadata-parser`][7].

Since Smart App Banners are only used for iOS devices, and only used when the developer intends an app banner to be shown, we are able to infer that in the presence of both app-links from twitter/fb metadata AND iOS Smart App banner markup, we can construct a native app banner than can direct the user to the app if it's installed, or the Play store details page if not.

[1]: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/applinks/add-to-content
[2]: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html

[5]: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=806385
[6]: https://github.com/mozilla/fathom
[7]: https://github.com/mozilla/page-metadata-parser

The implementation of this (a menu option, or page action, or an app banner) is a UX/design decision.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
1. The user is able to open a webpage's app if it is installed. This could be the ""official"" app as blessed by the page publisher or an unofficial one from the user's installed app catalogue.
1. If no suitable app is installed, then we can offer to go to the market place for you to install one.
1. The user is able to configure behaviour as to show or hide the banners, perhaps even on a per site basis.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search', 'Feature:AndroidIntegration', 'Feature:FennecTransition']",Open searchbox when trigerring assistant,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

To search the web and avoid Google, i'm currently using the classical Firefox for Android and use it with the Assistant Button (which place the cursor on the searchbox and opens the keyboard), and make the app ready to search. This is very convenient.

Currently thanks to #390 Fenix can be mapped to the assistant button, but doesn't open the keyboard. It's __definitely__ polishing and not a top priority, but would be great if it's the same behavior as the old Firefox.

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Keyboard shortcuts are currently supported (awesome!). Hopefully it shouldn't be too difficult to add a ""few"" more. 
   
Currently implemented
- space = page down
- ctrl + space = page up
 
### What/Requirements
Requested (asterisk mark ones I feel are of lower priority)
- t = scroll to the top
- b = scroll to the bottom
- n = next page/forward
- p = previous/back
- s = find in page (search)
- L = reload
- g or f = new tab
- u = switch focus to url bar and select all

- k = bookmarks *
- h = history *
- r = reader mode (if implemented) *
- x = print dialog *

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections']",[Bug] Collections UI uses a snackbar-like UI that feels out of place,"## Steps to reproduce

1. Open some tabs
2. tap ""Save to collection"" button

### Expected behavior

A UI like the one displayed in Signal or Gmail when multi-selecting items -- or like appears in the Library UI. 

### Actual behavior

There is a purple snackbar-like widget at the bottom of the screen.

Issues:

* There is a ""x"" ghost button that exits the tab selection UI; this is ambiguous because users may believe this simply dismisses the ""snackbar"" instead of cancelling
* ghost button that appears when a tab is selected 
* this doesn't feel like Android

['feature request 🌟'],Chrome like card UI based tab switcher to navigate between tabs,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Right now switching between tabs means navigating through a list of opened tabs. This type of navigation is unwieldy when the user has 20+ tabs open and quickly needs to switch between them based on the page content of opened tabs

### What/Requirements
The requirement is for a card based UI that shows up on swiping up from the tab count button. The user should be able to look at the tabs they've opened here with each tab showing up as a card. Each card would show a preview of the site opened in that tab with an option to close that tab. On tapping anywhere on a card, the user switches to that tab. Subsequently swiping up from the tab count button, the user is displayed the card based tab switcher again but the card they selected previously is the one that's selected.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections']",Swap tabs when using collections,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
When opening tabs from a collection, they are appended to the current tabs, even when using the option ""open tabs"". So what is the benefit of the collections if they still keep cluttering the tab list? 

I suggest to open all tabs of a collection at once and placing all current tabs to a new collection, therefore only showing the opened collection tabs on the tab list.

### What/Requirements
Add a feature to move current tabs to a new collection when opening tabs from any collection.
To improve the UX, also default to opening all tabs when tapping on an existing collection.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
- [x] #3005 
- [ ] Move existing tabs to a new collection
- [ ] Open all tabs when tapping on a collection as a default (separate tabs as an option when expanded) ","[{'user': 'Vesta Zare', 'user_id': 42752644, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': '@topotropic I think this is a great idea to consider :)'}, {'user': 'Felix Baumann', 'user_id': 5685512, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'collections could be like tab groups\r\n\r\nthe feature could be combined with multi account containers.

One collection  is for new shoes, one is for a new TV, etc.\r\nand then there are collections with the container work and so on.\r\n\r\none thing to consider:\r\nright now collections are still ""only"" bookmarks/something like Pocket. They don\'t keep the session. (session cookies, scroll position, video/audio playback position, text entered into forms) \r\n\r\nwhich is also a good thing. most tabs don\'t need that when they are saved and I\'m already looking forward to using collections in my daily life once Fenix gets released and sorting my open mobile tabs this way.\r\n\r\nthis definitely would make the most sense to me in a way that I can remove tabs from collections (once I\'m done with them/once I\'ve read them).\r\nHaving to remove them from both open tabs and the collection could be quite a hassle once the collection grows beyond a certain size.\r\n\r\nbtw. to me ""tab"" kind of implied collections actually save the session even though they don\'t. though ""save"" already indicates that it is implemented differently, it still was something I had to figure out on first use.\r\neither you want to change the wording (ux + testing with users what works best) or maybe saving the session isn\'t so bad after all?\r\n\r\nAs an example how I also would use collections:\r\nhave one/several pinned tab(s) (see #4579) at the top like the YouTube subscription feed or the main page of a news page.\r\nactual YouTube videos or news articles I want to read below.

(not automatically load them in a tab)\r\nfor example add news urls from BBC into the news collection. #4580\r\nSort urls that don\'t fall into any domain category by the app: a collection for all links opened from the Facebook app that don\'t belong to a domain like the bbc\r\n(I think, it makes sense to prioritize domain over app here, but it could be a setting)\r\n\r\nIf I surf on BBC and save an article, then Fenix should automatically add it to a collection if a filter applies else ask me which collection to choose.\r\nMaybe give me the option to create a new filter for this type of url.\r\nIf I selected more than one tab and one filter doesn\'t apply to all tabs, then let the user choose.\r\n\r\nI know this is an advanced feature but quite useful imo.\r\nIt could be realized similarly to the mail filters in thunderbird.\r\n\r\nI wrote this here because I wanted to start a discussion on the direction of collections (and I think that this is related to swapping collections) and I also wanted to suggest the ideas I had.\r\n~~I will now create separate feature suggestions for pinning tabs in collections and a filtering system and add links to this comment.~~\r\nEdit: Done'}, {'user': 'Vesta Zare', 'user_id': 42752644, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': '@boek ^^'}, {'user': 'Tukusej’s Sirs', 'user_id': 5111894, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'Although #3005 is closed as it dealt with Fennec, it is not working that way in Fenix, which I why I have open another issue #11463.'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Toolbar']",Slim address bar on scroll,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Mobile screens have less space, so browsers usually auto-hide the address bar (also planned for Fenix). However, that can be used for phishing, whether [by adding a fake one](https://jameshfisher.com/2019/04/27/the-inception-bar-a-new-phishing-method/) or simply by considering the fact that the user does not see the URL at all times. 

Therefore, I propose a simple solution that is already used in a competitor [Yandex Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yandex.browser) - instead of hiding the address bar completely, just make it thinner when scrolled.

The design of the thin bar has already been implemented in your browser [Firefox Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.rocket), so feel free to copy that.

### What/Requirements
Add a thinner address bar variant that appears when the user scrolls the page. It can either have button hints of the real bar (certificate, tabs, menu) which would then open on a tap, or it only has the address and security icon which would transform to a full bar on tap.

['feature request 🌟'],Fill the search/address bar by tapping on a suggested search/address suggestion,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
If you're trying to type a longer search, and you see a suggestion that is part of what you want to search but does not contain all your search terms (for example, you want to search for ""houses in city for sale with pools"", you've typed ""houses in city"" and ""houses in city for sale"" is suggested), you currently have to type the rest of the search until your full search is selected. This can also be nice with websites. You want to go to ""website.com/shop/"", you've typed in ""web"", and ""website.com"" is suggested. In both of these, just selecting the suggestion will just bring you to the bare selection without the extra stuff that you wanted (""with pools"" and ""/shop/"").

### What/Requirements
Add something that I can tap on for each suggestion that will fill the search bar with its value.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
I can activate a suggestion in some way that sets the search bar to its value.

"['🐞 bug', 'P3', 'needs:gv', 'Feature:Forms', 'S2', 'Feature:IME']","[Bug]  Text input problems: cursor jumps around, spaces are removed, characters are duplicated","## Steps to reproduce
1. find text field
2. start typing a sentence.
### Expected behavior
cursor won't jump, letters will stay in place, spaces won't be removed and parts won't be duplicated
### Actual behavior
all of the above happens :(

### Info
Also reproducible in Firefox Focus with GeckoView
I've noticed that typing incredibly slow avoids the issue. 

### Device information

* Android device: Galaxy S5 (I've also tested on other devices such as a Galaxy S4, Bluestacks 4)
* Fenix version: Nightly 190707 18:02 (Build #11881816)

It doesn't look like Firefox for Windows. This is more of a branding thing, consistency and appearance thing.

### What/Requirements
Change light theme:
Make the address box white to match desktop in light theme

Change dark theme:
Use Grey 70 of Photon Design System (PDS) for toolbar
Use Grey 60 of PDS for address bar

['feature request 🌟'],Integrate PDF Viewer,"One of my favorite workflows in Firefox for Android (Fennec) was the ability to view PDF files without permanently saving them in storage. There was an option to download the file, or open in another viewer.

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/tvXjEW2.jpg)

Sometimes passing the file directly to viewer apps (then delete from cache) is storage-efficient for mobile devices, as many PDF viewers do not have an option to delete the file (including the Drive viewer itself).

There are two possible ways to do this:
+ Pass the PDF file directly to PDF viewers (Google Drive, etc.)
+ Include pdf.js viewer into Fenix

I personally prefer the latter for advanced features (especially in viewing and navigation options), while there are some features that might be missing or broken in Fenix (such as zoom gestures and print).","[{'user': 'Sören Hentzschel', 'user_id': 1100614, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': ""+1 for pdf.js in Fenix, that would be awesome!\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is https://addons.mozilla.org/de/android/addon/android-pdf-js/ for _Fennec_.

Close a tab or open a new tab in the background.

The associated action (undo and switch, respectively), should have a different text color as to highlight that it is an action (similar to how this is done in Fennec, the explanation being white and the action being blue).

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections']",pin tab in collection,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
It would be nice if I would be able to pin one or several tabs inside a collection

for example: the YouTube subscription feed or the main page of a news website is pinned and below that are videos/articles I want to read later.
I open the pinned tab, if I want to explore more videos/articles or. I open one of the videos/articles to watch/read it and then remove it from my ""watch later"" collection.

This might be a contradiction to #4446 
the idea there is: sync open pinned tabs to mobile and make them available through one collection

But I'm also not sure if I like that approach, since you can't get notifications from such tabs. (collections have no session after all)

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections']",filter new or existing tabs into collections (similar to Thunderbird mail filter),"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Depending on the implementation of collections it would be nice if Firefox could automatically sort new tabs into certain collection(s) depending on the domain or the app it was opened from (and not automatically download them in a tab, atleast when you let Fenix open tabs in the background without switching apps, like Firefox currently does)

For example Fenix would then add news urls from BBC into the news collection.
Urls that don't fall into any domain category should be sorted by the app they are opened from:
a collection for all links opened from the Facebook app that don't belong to a domain like the bbc
(I think, it makes sense to prioritize domain over app here, but it could be a setting)

If I surf on BBC and save an article, then Fenix should automatically add it to a collection if a filter applies else ask me which collection to choose.
Maybe give me the option to create a new filter for this type of url.
If I selected more than one tab and one filter doesn't apply to all tabs, then let the user choose.
Add a button that auto saves all selected tabs separately to the correct collection.

I know this is an advanced feature but quite useful imo.
It could be realized similarly to the mail filters in Thunderbird.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
* working tab filter system
* gui to configure filters
* auto filter tabs coming from other apps

"['feature request 🌟', '🙅 waiting', 'Feature:Privacy&Security']",DNS over HTTPS,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
As a user i want to Protect myself while browsing the web From Man-in-the-middle attack and make sure Attackers cannot trick users into visiting a fake website by manipulating DNS responses for domains that are outside their control.

### What/Requirements:
**Secure DNS**:
To ensure your DNS queries remain private, you should use a resolver that supports secure DNS transport such as DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT).
**DNSSEC:**
DNSSEC allows a user, application, or recursive resolver to trust that the answer to their DNS query is what the domain owner intends it to be.
**TLS 1.3 :** is Supported In Firefox Fenix 👍
**Encrypted SNI:**
Encrypted SNI keeps the hostname private when you are visiting an Encrypted SNI enabled site on Cloudflare by concealing your browser’s requested hostname from anyone listening on the Internet.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
Dns-over-Https option in the settings or in about:config like Fennec browser.
You can test your browser here:

#### Description & Product Manager / Data Scientist User Story
- As a product owner, I want to know if people are annoyed by notifications, and use the Android settings to turn them off.

#### Hypothesis
- We believe that users may turn off notifications when presented with irrelevant notifications. We'll use the notifications state to measure whether our notifications are useful/not.

#### What questions will you answer with this data?
Whether users are turning off Fenix notifications.

#### Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions? Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements?
Android allows users to turn off notifications for apps, so we should keep track of whether our notifications are annoying to users, and whether they're turning them off.

#### What probes (suggested, if applicable)
- [NotificationManagerCompat.areNotificationsEnabled](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/NotificationManagerCompat.html#areNotificationsEnabled()) API 19+

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search']",Directly access a website when it shows up in suggestions,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

The goal is to quickly access a website that's not been visited yet. The user knows how the website's domain approximately look like but not completely. Or they know it but typing it completely is a bit painful on a mobile keyboard.
The goal is to access it in one click instead of more clicks.

### What/Requirements

The user types the start of a website's domain name, and the search suggestions proposes the full domain name. Clicking it should access the domain directly instead of going to the search engine.

This is the behavior of old Firefox.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

Here is a STR with duckduckgo:
1. type ""hattrick""
=> duckduckgo proposes ""hattrick.org""
2. tap ""hattrick.org""

"['feature request 🌟', 'P2', 'needs:UR', 'Feature:Browsing']",[Bug] Page opened from homescreen shortcut is deleted without warning in some cases,"First, I am assuming the following behaviour is intended by design, please correct me if I'm wrong: 
- if a page was opened from the nav bar (either via a search or a direct URL), pressing the BACK button on the phone will go back to the list of tabs and a tab for this page will be logged and displayed
- on the contrary, if a page was opened from a shortcut on the homescreen, pressing the BACK button on the phone will close the page and send Fenix to the background.

Based on this assumption, I think there may be the following bug. I hope I'll describe it correctly with words :)

## Steps to reproduce
1) Create a homescreen shortcut for a webpage in Fenix 
Go to tabs list, remove the tab for this page and exit Fenix (close the app)
2) Click on the homescreen shortcut
3) Once the page is opened, go to the tabs list by pressing on the tabs pile icon
Check that tab for this webpage is displayed at the top of the list
Click on this tab
4) Let it display, and now press the BACK button of the phone
 

### Expected behavior
The list of tabs is displayed, and either of the 2 options should happen:
a) as page A has been logged and displayed to the user in the tabs list, it could now behave like a page that was open directly from the browser, ie tab A could just stay there at the top of the list.
b) or it could still be considered as a shortcut page and be deleted, but at least with a warning/undo message as for any other deleted tab in the list. And the deletion should be undoable.

### Actual behavior
The list of tabs is displayed.
Tab A is visually removed from the list of tabs (we can even see the animation) but no warning/undo message is displayed.

Right now, if I open a page in Firefox desktop, enable reader view, bookmark the page, and then try to open this link in Fenix, I just get an ""Invalid Address"" error page since the link starts with about:reader?url=... (And since the underlying page URL is percent-encoded, it's hard to just remove the protocol part.) 

### What/Requirements

about:reader?url= links should opens, ideally in Reader Mode. But even just loading the page would be better. Fennec opens these links in its reader view.

Yes, it has the same problem. But it can be fixed using ""Chrome UA on Google for Firefox Android"" extension. Normal site layout should be default in all browsers. Unusual layouts should be triggered by extensions or non-default settings.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search']",[Bug] Indicate that the entered address is direct URL or search query,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

When entering URL into the ""Search or enter address"" control, it's unclear whether the entered address will be opened directly as an URL or will be sent as a search query to the selected search engine.

Sometimes the user intention is to enter the website address directly into the address bar, but due to accidental error (space, comma instead of dot etc.) the address becomes invalid and being handles as a free text query for the selected search engine. As result user gets the search results instead of navigation to the desired page.

Opposite situation, when user wants to search a simple query but it's being handled as URL instead.

### What/Requirements

As user types the address, the search engine icon should change from logo of selected search engine to generic URL icon to indicate the user whether the address is going to be opened directly or sent to search engine.

"['Feature:Bookmarks', 'Feature:Collections']",[UX] Explore value and usability of organized living tabs (collections),"## User Story
- As a user I understand how collections can be useful for me and how they are different than bookmarks. 

Please see user feedback in this [spreadsheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_scqRuhOezFDiiTN47ir9henxSzWFQwhERoryWWcC08/edit#gid=0)(filter for Collections)

### Acceptance Criteria
What should happen when a collection is restored (restoring a session or updated content?)
When saving tabs to a collection, does the user want to keep those tabs open in the tabs tray or remove them?
How might the user make best use of collections in a way that is different from bookmarks?
How might the user want to re-order tabs from within or between collections?
Does the user want to be able to save a collection as a homescreen shortcut?


See related files requests:

-Some users thought we had replaced bookmarks with collections (and didn't have bookmarks) and wondered why collections didn't sync with desktop bookmarks.

Multiple benefits. It'd be easier to show a particular element of a video, for example. Also, it'd be another feature to draw new users

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

When video is played back at full-screen, one can pinch to zoom in on a video and pan around.

Now the Shortcuts button has been removed from the Search screen, could the Scan button be removed or placed elsewhere?

That way we'd all win back a bit of vertical space to fill with search results. The small number of search results is IMHO a big step back from Fennec, see eg #1161, #479.

eg
- put it where it is in Fennec, on the right hand side of the URL bar?
or
- leave it where it is, but make it disappear as soon as I start typing in the URL bar and give the vertical space back to search results (I'm unlikely to want to Scan after I have started typing???)

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
PWAs may want to receive data from other apps, such as sharing a URL to Twitter or sharing an image to Squoosh. Web Share Target lets installed PWAs show up as entries in the Android share sheet.

### What/Requirements
PWAs that define a ShareTarget in their web app manifest will show up as entries in the Android share sheet. 

We can use Sharing Shortcuts to display entries in the share sheet dynamically. Note that this is different to Chrome's WebAPKs, since those are signed APK files that can create static share entries. We can use Direct Share (normally used to let users share to a specific person) to support Web Share Target on Android 6 and above.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:PrivateBrowsing', 'Feature:PWA']","Split the single 'open *all* links in PM' pref into 2 settings: one for 3rd party, one for shortcuts","### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

_Note: this was originally expressed as a post-closure comment in #5341, which was not the right place. It may also be related to #5742 and #514_

First, here are 2 assumptions that make sense to me (at least ;) ):

1) Shortcuts to websites on phone's homescreen are a very powerful feature to avoid cluttering the phone with applications, either for PWA-enabled sites or for non PWA-enabled sites.
This request deals with non PWA-enabled sites only: in this case, and in order to emulate ""PWA""-like behaviour, sites are often in a persistent context, login/session/cookie-wise. Therefore they **cannot** be opened in Private mode, where all initial context would be lost.
(Yet I understand that some users may want to have their shortcuts always open in Private mode, although that is not my way).

2) On the contrary, there is a need to be able to open 3rd party links in Private mode, as they usually don't need any login/session/cookie context and do not need to be recorded.
My understanding is that also includes custom tabs, does'nt it?

The problem is that there is only **one** setting that defines the mode 3rd party links and shortcurt are opened in:  ""open all links in private mode"".

### What/Requirements
The requirement is to split the single 'open all links in PM' preference into 2 different settings:

    Setting A: 'open all 3rd party links in PM' (which would open all links from other applications, but not Fenix shortcuts)
    Setting B: 'open all Fenix shortcuts in PM' that would apply to Fenix page shortcuts on the phone's homescreen only, obviously.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
When setting A is ON and setting B is OFF, a page/custom tab opened by a 3rd party will open in private mode, whereas a page shortcut will open in non-private mode, in full logged in context.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:HomeScreen']",Make the Fenix homepage be the contents desktop Bookmarks Toolbar folder.  Reintroduce Tab Groups on desktop as what is now Fenix Collections,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Top Sites, Pinned Sites, and Collections are an over-engineering of bookmarks.  The Mobile Bookmarks folder is like an appendage of the desktop bookmarks.  Why not have what is the Bookmarks Toolbar folder on desktop be the main page of the mobile browser?  It would encourage creating Firefox Sync accounts, use of the Bookmarks Toolbar folder on desktop Firefox, and new users would immediately see the cohesive experience between desktop and mobile.  [others with the same sentiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/dez7hh/does_anyone_actually_use_mobile_bookmarks/)

### What/Requirements
Make the Fenix homepage be the contents of the desktop's Bookmark Toolbar folder.
** as a bonus, you could also reintroduce Tab Groups on the desktop and link them with what is Collections on Fenix.

['feature request 🌟'],Bookmark tags,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

I often use tags to flexibly categorize my bookmarks and to search them faster without altering their title

### What/Requirements

The ability to edit bookmark tags, like in ~~Fennec~~ Firefox for Desktop, and to use them as a search criterion.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

When editing a bookmark, I can enter a comma-separated list of tags in a ""tags"" field.
When typing something in the address bar, tags are searched too.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:PrivateBrowsing']",Provide a way to open Fenix in non-private mode (whatever the previous mode was),"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

Today, Chrome, Fenix and Edge do not have any way to open the browser directly in non-private mode, even if the previous browsing was done in private mode, and to open it to the last page that was displayed in non-private mode (or the browser home page with tabs).
Yes, there is a shortcut to open a new tab in non-private mode, but that doesn't fulfill the need.

This feature would be quite helpful to provide consistency in the navigation between private and non-private mode (along with another request, #5170, which is to open the currently viewed page in the other mode).

Having that capability in Fenix could be a nice differentiator in favour of Fenix.

### What/Requirements
Provide a second shortcut almost similar to the one used to open Fenix in private mode, that would open Fenix is non-private mode, and land on the last browsed page by keeping non-private browsing history of course (or on the tabs home page if history was lost) - the latter is different from the private shortcut that opens per design on a new private tab.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
After opening Fenix in private mode, pressing the non-private shortcut takes the user to the last page displayed in non-private mode, by keeping non-private browsing history.

The Quick Settings Tile should toggle between opening links in private mode and normal mode when tapped. The active state should reflect the current mode.

Unfortunately, on anything but small phones, the GUI elements that are on the right side of the screen aren't reachable for a right-handed user. The layout is as follows:

TP icon | https://url | [tabs] :menu:

Now, I can reach the entirety of the URL, even though this is undeeded: I can't foresee any use case in which I specifically want to click on part of the URL in the main view. So being able to reach the left part is enough to open it up for input.
On the other hand, the [tabs] list and the hamburger menu are on the extreme right, out of range for my thumb.

So, the design looks awkward and weird (URL on bottom), without realizing the benefit (one-handed operation for common use).

Consider reordering the visual elements (preferring a right-handed default, as this is 90% of the world population), or making them flippable depending on user handedness.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search']","List of search shortcuts, not clear that top line is default","When entering search screen I'm presented with ""Search With:"" and a list of search shortcuts

It's not clear that the first one (Google in my case) is the default and I don't need to do anything to select it. I can just start typing.

I know there is a G icon top left but that's probably easy to miss for a new user when presented with the big list front & center and an instruction ""Search with""

would it make sense to have something in the list to indicate that Google is the default? Otherwise you could end up with users thinking they need to tap Google before every search?

- Add text ""(Default)"" after the first line might be enough? Or have Google emboldened some way
or
- don't show Google in the list of search shortcut, only show the alternates to the currently selected search provider

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections']",Tab groups,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

I really like the idea of Collections but I've seen Chrome's Tab groups today and I think they are pretty handy.

The user would be able to quickly jump between tabs in a Collection because the present solution forces the user to open the tab view and to scroll all the way down to the specific Collection.

### What/Requirements

I got 2 ideas in mind:

1. Nearly the same look like Chrome (can be seen at the pictures)
2. Bring a **Collection button** to the ""slide up menu of the awesomebar"" (**preferred solution** & unique one & probably the easiest one)

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

Number 2:

* There is an extra button besides Share, Bookmarks, Reading Mode to open the Collection the **current tab is within**
* By clicking on this button all other tabs from the Collection are displayed ontop of the awesomebar inside the ""slide up menu"" in an horizontally scrollable area
* By clicking on a tab the user can open it

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search']","Suggestion: redesign Search screen using a drawer like the main Tab page, gives room for Top Sites and access to alternate search engines after typing","I’ve whinged a lot about how I dislike the Fenix search experience. I thought I might do something more constructive and sketch a suggestion for improvements, I’ve mocked up a few pics at the bottom. Maybe you'll find it useful?

My current problems with Fenix search page

- text entry bar hard to reach one handed (text bar is at top of screen)
- search shortcuts list appears when enter search screen, uses screen space which may be required for Top Sites
- search shortcut can only be selected before entering text - shortcuts get replaced by search suggestions when typing
- Scan button is a bit of an orphan
- Scan button uses a whole row of screen space for one button
- Shortcuts button was not liked by users (I don’t know why)

Suggestion
- move text entry bar to bottom (controversial I know)
- use the “drawer” metaphor as in a normal Fenix tab
- put all the extra stuff in the drawer:- scan; paste from clipboard; search shortcut icons

Advantages
- same metaphor as normal tabs:- text entry is at bottom, pull up drawer for extra stuff
- when opening a new tab or moving to the Search screen, there is plenty of empty screen space to show Top Sites - because search shortcuts are now in the drawer
- search shortcuts can be selected at any time (before or during text entry) by opening the drawer
- saves screen space because Scan button is in the drawer
- open drawer covers a History suggestion not a search suggestion, which is fine because opening the drawer means user is interested in scan, paste or alternate search engines not History

Mock up

(1) on entering the Search screen see Top Sites in thumb friendly vertical position, an empty text entry field, and the closed drawer

![Search bar 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40568887/66713289-a167de80-eda0-11e9-8d34-6729791a0648.jpg)

(3) when typing with the drawer open, it obscures a History suggestion, not a search suggestion, which is fine

- the option to double-tap the left portion of the video player screen to go a few seconds (5 to 10?) backwards
- the option to double-tap the right portion of the video player screen to go a few seconds (5 to 10?) forwards

The amount of seconds could also increase with the amount of taps.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections']",Collections should be live/dynamic and should not need to be stored again to update,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
My main problem with collections at present is that I cannot work within them; they are not ""live"". If I open a collection and use it then the collection doesn't remember what I've done. If I save the resulting set of tabs it is saved as a new collection, not as an update to an existing collection, so I need to save and then delete my old collection. This is a cumbersome way to work with this generally good idea.

### What/Requirements
Rather than them being snapshots of a current tab set they need to be live, or dynamic. i.e if I work within a collection, navigate tabs to new pages, open links in new tabs, close tabs etc, the collection should remember this. When I've finished (or run out of time!) I should not need to save the tabs back to a collection, the collection should just remember where I was. This is how I expected the old sessions concept to work. 

Another way of thinking about this is to think of each collection as a separate firefox device. When I close my browser it remembers my tabs state; I want my collections to remember my tabs state when I close them.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
I think the last paragraph captures my vision best. Ultimately I just want collections to be less cumbersome to use as they have a lot of potential.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections']",New tab could create a new collection/session,"Summary: When a new tab is opened, start it in a new collection. Note I know this doesn't fit the current workflow.

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
I've been struggling to understand the real benefit of collections, mainly because of how they're implemented. The concept of sessions was clearer to me (even if the implementation is the same) - I start a new session on a new topic, open links in new tabs, surf, see where I end up, but all tabs which are opened are still part of that session because they are part of that topic.

If I open a new tab without following a link then it will probably (possibly? that's for telemetry and surveys to tell you) be unrelated to the current ""session"" and can therefore be kept separate.

Note I know that my last assumption is not always the case, but for me it often is.

### What/Requirements
First I think that the current workflow for collections needs to change: #6298 

When I open a new tab I want it to open in a new session/collection and preserve the state of my existing session/collection so I can come back to it later.

Probably this behaviour should be optional as it's a big change from the way that all (?) browsers currently work.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
When collections are dynamic snapshots of a browsing session (rather than just static collections of bookmarks) and it's easy to create new sessions on new topics and come back to the previous session later.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:MainMenu']",[Bug] - UI design - rationalise different kinds of pop up menu ,"When tapping Fenix buttons I can get one of three different kinds of menu appearing

1. Android floating menu about 2/3 screen width with underlying content normal brightness (3 dot menu button), or
2. full screen width ""windowshade"" up from bottom of screen with underlying content dimmed (shield, padlock buttons), or
3. list of inline text (Shortcuts button)

Nit picks but I find it inelegant, particularly the difference between types 1 and 2.

I know you are working to rationalise the QAB and 3-dot menu e.g. #4281 and #6310, would it be worth rationalising the three different kinds of menus particularly 1 and 2?

Advantages

- more width to put the icons which are currently in the QAB horizontally at the bottom of the 3 dot menu, if that's the way you want to go, maybe could put Open In App, Reader, Share, Bookmark, Back, Forward, Reload across bottom of 3 dot menu whole screen width???

- it would help with #6291 because Reload icon would be pushed to bottom right corner of screen and would overlay 3 dot menu icon.

- more consistency between menu types looks a nicer IMHO",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
['feature request 🌟'],Release pipeline: Ensure metadata is sane when a push happens on the master branch,"### Why

In the taskgraph migration, I regressed twice the version name of the release APK. More precisely, I first fixed it in https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/5635, then I fixed it again in https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/5811.

We can prevent the issue from being visible at the very end of the pipeline, on the day we ship Fenix. 

### What/Requirements

The version name is encoded in `AndroidManifest.xml`. Despite what its name tells, it's a binary file. We need a special tool like `apktool` (included in the Android `build-tools`, if I remember correctly) or [androguard](https://pypi.org/project/androguard/).

We actually had a similar situation in Fennec ([bug 1540152](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1540152)) We chose to run the checks done in the push-apk task also right after the APK was generated. Why the push-apk task in particular? It uses androguard to get the APK metadata. 

I think we should do the same. Moreover, this project can leverage one of the taskgraph features: [graphs that depend on other graphs](https://johanlorenzo.github.io/blog/2019/10/24/taskgraph-is-now-deployed-to-the-biggest-mozilla-mobile-projects.html#other-features-i-like). In other words, we can generate the nightly/production APKs on push to master, validate their metadata, and then **promote** these APKs to be published. 

This way, we fail fast and we ship even faster.

['feature request 🌟'],Prevent Fenix from using large amounts of data when the app is backgrounded without the user's consent,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
A user reported on Slack:
> Is it expected right now that Firefox Preview will use data indefinitely when in the background? ... I was reading a news article last night which apparently had an embedded video. I backgrounded the browser and went to bed. Woke up to 7GB of mobile data used  while Firefox just kept dutifully playing the video

The core issue is that normal Fenix use may **spend users' money (on their data connection) without their consent.** We should put in safeguards to prevent this from happening when users don't intend it to.

Note that we need to be concerned about the app deliberately downloading while the app is backgrounded (e.g. when playing a video like this case) and when the app isn't deliberately downloading, i.e. due to a GV bug (this may have been a cause of the Fennec bugs mentioned below).

We've had similar issues on Fennec ([bug 1389499](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1389499), [bug 1022569](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1022569), & there may be others).

### What/Requirements

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

"['feature request 🌟', 'needs:UX-investigation']",Design left-handed mode,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
The current design places the most important actions near the bottom right corner of the screen.  This is very convenient for right-handed users, but not for left-handed ones.

### Engineering note
Once we support RTL layout, providing an option to toggle it regardless of locale would be a relatively small engineering story.  This is one potential solution, but there may be better ones.

Good: most actions will be positioned near the bottom left hand corner of the screen\r\n2. Bad: my language is LTR\r\n    * My Back direction is left and\xa0my Forward direction is right;\xa0RTL layout turns it around\r\n    * I read from left to right;\xa0RTL layout makes all text right-aligned\r\n\r\nSo, I want some things positioned LTR and other things RTL. Unlike an RTL language where everything is right-to-left.\r\n\r\nAdditionally: most RTL users are right-handed, but when they use the RTL layout, won’t the main menu be flipped and located on the left hand side of the screen, away from their thumbs?\r\n\r\nSo, how is handedness different from language orientation, and how are they the same?

In the physical world, the status quo may not be the way we like it. But onscreen, why can’t we change things?\r\n\r\nThis is why.\r\n\r\n> …many left handed people work many things right handed way.

Some fight and use left-handed devices, but many adapted by simply learning how operate like right-handed people.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, then, left-handed people come to expect things to operate in a right-handed way, _even though it conflicts with their natural inclination_.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Telemetry']",Consider enabling telemetry in debug builds,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Developers write code on debug builds: it is on these debug builds that they'll notice issues with the code they've written and fix them. As such, debug builds should be as close as possible to what users are using: the release builds.

Currently, telemetry is disabled on debug builds: imo, we should re-enable it.

### What/Requirements

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
- Telemetry collection & uploads are enabled on debug builds
- Release telemetry is not skewed by debug builds (e.g. telemetry from debug builds is stored in a separate bucket from release builds by app id)
- Telemetry upload is disabled during unit & UI testing

These are the criteria that desktop uses.

---

Some notes from our discussion on Slack:
- Reason for originally not enabling it in debug: num users of Fenix are relatively small and we don't want to overwhelm the telemetry data (esp with automated tests).
- We should consider if contributors outside Mozilla would expect that they are submitting debug telemetry by default.
- ""Could telemetry get disabled during testing somehow (ci) but be enabled in the builds themselves, even debug?  That's roughly what happens on desktop""
  - On Desktop, telemetry is always on, but upload is not. This is the same behaviour of Glean. Nothing prevents Glean consumers to init glean and set set upload to disabled.","[{'user': 'Alessio Placitelli', 'user_id': 883721, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': '\r\n> Currently, telemetry is disabled on debug builds: imo, we should re-enable it.\r\n> ### What/Requirements\r\n> ### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)\r\n> \r\n>     * Telemetry collection & uploads are enabled on debug builds\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure upload is strictly required here.

Instead, they must set the initial window background without any theme information. Some apps resolve this by using a static splash screen, fake UI, or a transparent window background. Others use color hints from the OS to take a guess at the chosen theme, as Fenix does.\r\n\r\n### Upsides and Downsides\r\nHere\'s a summary of a write-up I did for an [earlier bug](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/599):\r\n\r\n1. Static splash screen window background: Google originally advised against splash screens. But it\'s become increasingly clear that even fairly spartan apps need to perform a second or two of work on initial install. Google now uses splash screens with their own apps. However, there are a few issues. The color of the splash screen needs to look good next to the color of the chosen theme. Otherwise, a jarring flash of dark or light can appear before the real UI appears. There\'s also no time to measure anything, so it has to be simple.\r\n\r\n2. Fake UI splash screen window background: This ""fake"" splash screen pretends to be the user interface of the app. This seems ideal, except there\'s not enough information to make it appear identical to the real UI. The same rule applies to measuring layouts as obtaining theme colors. Android offers no time to measure layouts or to obtain theme colors from disk. This means a fake UI must be very, very simple. It probably makes sense to strip down the UI a lot and add an element that indicates the app is not ready. Elements cannot be placed relative to one another, only relative to the screen edges (ignoring system UI). Different phones\' aspect ratios and camera cutouts may cause these measurements to appear considerably off from correctly measured layouts.\r\n\r\n3. Transparent window background: Lacking sufficient information, this sounds ideal. But it\'s probably the worst option. If the user presses the launcher icon and a transparent window background gets shown, there is no visual feedback that the app started. The user almost always believes that either Android did not receive the tap or the app or OS is frozen, so they\'ll tap again once or twice. It always feels broken. Adding a logo or brand mark to a transparent screen can still get missed by the user.\r\n\r\n4. Using OS theme colors as window background: For Android versions 8 and later, it\'s possible to detect the colors from the OS theme and use them. Since Fenix has ""Follow system colors"" as a default, this is likely to match colors with Fenix. However, a user can always choose different colors for Fenix and then it won\'t.\r\n\r\n5. Using a splash activity: If you have time to measure and show an Activity, you have enough time to show the real UI. This simply wastes the user\'s time and doesn\'t even solve this bug.\r\n\r\nFennec does not have or solve the same problem because it doesn\'t have a built-in dark mode. It has a white splash screen shown on cold start, which can always look identical. It seems that app is using option 2, but without dynamic colors.'}, {'user': 'Michael Comella', 'user_id': 759372, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': ""I wonder if we remove the system's placeholder frame and draw directly to our app (ideal from a perceived startup performance perspective) if we can improve the perception here.""}, {'user': 'Michael Comella', 'user_id': 759372, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': ""We don't expect the perf team to address flickering anymore – removing perf tags.""}, {'user': None, 'user_id': 26384082, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'See: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/17373 This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

So to fix this, whenever I save a collection, Firefox will create a folder in bookmarks with folder name as collection name and store the list of websites in that collection in that folder.

If they\'re easily accessible bookmark folders as you describe they should really be linked to actual bookmark folders in some way, being completely separated doesn\'t really make sense to me. This ignores the fact however, that they\'re sort of groups of saved sessions, given that you can click back to navigate to previously visited pages when opening a tab from one. I\'m not too sure what the use of this is, but it makes them even more different to bookmarks and harder to link up. They\'re a little bit of a few different things, and as such struggle to be a defined thing in themself. \r\n\r\nWhat you quoted from was only secondary to my main point and is something I\'d like to see, but it\'s more a nice-to-have than a direct issue that they lack that feature.

"['feature request 🌟', 'needs:ac', 'P2', 'Feature:Telemetry', 'S3']",[Telemetry] Add ANR (Application Not Responsive) to the Fenix metrics,"Owner: Product Manager

#### Description & Product Manager / Data Scientist User Story
ANR is an important metric related to application stability. It is reported (alongwith Crash Rate) in the Play App Store. We will be using ANR as stability metric for Fenix release

We already measure three types of crashes in Fenix metrics: caught and uncaught exceptions and native crashes. Rather than accessing Play Store we would like to keep a count of ANR along with these metrics.

#### Hypothesis

#### What questions will you answer with this data?

Measure ANR on platforms with  different memory use/os versions. Keep track of ANR so it doesn't increase.

#### Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions? Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements?

A lower ANR is better for user experience and is an indicator of app quality

#### What probes (suggested, if applicable)

The [URL standard says](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-rendering-elision):

> When the full host cannot be rendered, browsers should elide domain labels starting from the lowest-level domain label. For `example, examplecorp.com.evil.com` should be elided as `...com.evil.com`, not examplecorp.com...`.

Fennec and Chrome on Android do the right thing: they show `...ook.com.facebook.com.evil.com` and `facebook.com.evil.com`, respectively.

Firefox should allow an option to hide it in landscape mode only, as in portrait mode the status bar does not take up as much space.

### Behaviours

Communicate connectivity status subtly by **enabling/disabling the Sync button based on sync process completion and availability of internet connection**:

1. Ensure that the sync process can only be requested once, until it finishes running.
    - IF the user taps the “Sync Now” button
    - THEN disable “Sync Now” button, until the sync process has finished

2. If sync is interrupted, we should keep trying without overtly communicating our status.
    - IF the user taps the “Sync Now” button
    - AND the internet suddenly cuts off
    - THEN keep trying to sync.
This means that the “Sync Now” button is disabled until internet is restored and the sync process has finished. Through the disabled “Sync” button, the user will realise that something happens with the internet.

3. If sync has the potential to fail, disable it before it can happen
    - IF the phone has no internet
    - AND the user has not tapped the “Sync Now” button
    - THEN disable “Sync Now” button

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:PrivateBrowsing', 'Feature:History']",History Settings,"### Why
I hate browsing history. I mostly prefer browsing in private mode, especially on mobile. Always. By default.
When I used Fenix first time, private mode stayed activated even after closing the browser. I was looking for a browser with such property on Android so I started to use it as my main browser. But now that thing is gone.

### What I want
I think adding history settings identical to Desktop Firefox would be the best solution with highest acceptance among users. After all, those settings are a reason why I use Firefox instead of a Chromium-based browser on desktop. Another (but probably worse) option I would accept is making private mode disabling/enabling process like on Safari on iOS.

### Problems in current solutions
I will explain part-by-part what are problems with current private mode options.
1. **Open in private tab.** It doesn't work. Even if I explicitly select Fenix private mode in ""open with"" menu, custom tabs are not private, they get recorded in history.
2. **Clear data when quit.** It is actually ""clear data when user presses quit"". It is just a shortcut to clear history, not what I wanted.
3. **Shortcut to open private mode.** 1) It is too geeky; 2) it doesn't work if your launcher doesn't support widgets, or you don't want to add complexity to home screen; 3) it actually opens private mode's address bar, not private mode itself. Single touch on ""back"" button (for example, to access bookmarks) opens non-private browsing.","[{'user': None, 'user_id': 44001490, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': ""Personally I don't use the private browsing mode by default, but browsing history has been disabled for as long as I've used the desktop Firefox, and so was [on Fennec](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/157768/how-to-disable-browsing-history-in-android-firefox).""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a user opens a page that tries to open pop-ups, the user is presented the message ""Prevent this site from opening a pop-up window?"" followed by the URL of the page and the buttons ""DENY"" and ""ALLOW"".

If I ""deny"", do I deny Firefox the possibility to block them, or do I deny the page the possibility to open them?

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:RequestDesktopSite']",Setting to request desktop sites by default,"_This issue is similar to #5725, #5471 and #5761. However, those three issues were confusingly created by the same user, are lacking a lot of detail and are quite poorly written. I'm hoping to start a discussion on a clean slate._

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

With mobile screens getting larger and connectivity speeds improving, I've increasingly been wanting to use desktop versions of most websites I visit. Additionally, some mobile sites simply don't work properly or are missing content, observations echoed in #233.

""Always request desktop mode"" was a popular feature requested for the old Android browser, Fennec. See [Bug 790954](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790954) and at least half a dozen other ones. It led to quite a lot of discussions at the time, and as far as I can tell from the Play Store reviews, it's still something that is requested regularly nowadays.

There used to be an extension for this, [desktop-by-default](https://addons.mozilla.org/android/addon/desktop-by-default), but it no longer exists.

### What/Requirements

Two potential solutions were discussed for Fennec:
* saving the preference on a per website basis. This proved hard due to redirections amongst other problems (see [this comment](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790954#c15)). It was dismissed.
* a global setting allowing users to load desktop versions of websites by default. This seems to have been the preferred solution, but was never implemented (maybe because extensions provided this back then?).

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

Based on past discussions, I'm suggesting to add a global setting ""Request desktop sites by default"", possibly in the _Accessibility_ section. Would this be an acceptable approach?

Bring back the QAB. I saw a bug was filed because people were confused by having more than one location (the QAB and the menu bar) to look for a feature.

['feature request 🌟'],Open context menus off of hamburger buttons on touch down rather than up,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Chrome's hamburger menu in its UI is opened when the touch down event is received, whereas in Firefox Preview we open the menu when the touch up event is processed. This results in the menu opening feel snappier on my phone in Chrome compared to Firefox Preview.

You can test this by putting your finger on the hamburger button and touch and hold the screen and don't lift. In Chrome the menu pops up immediately after the touch is initiated, whereas Firefox Preview doesn't open the menu until the finger is lifted.

### What/Requirements
The menu should be opened when the touch down event is received. We should also handle the touch-hold-lift gesture somehow, for example by closing the menu if you lift your finger after holding it down with a delay.

When overwriting the original, a rollback journal or write-ahead log WAL file is used just as it would be for any other database transaction. This means that when VACUUMing a database, as much as twice the size of the original database file is required in free disk space.\r\n\r\nFrom `PRAGMA optimize` docs, it seems that while usually fast, regressive cases could be slow/expensive:\r\n> To achieve the best long-term query performance without the need to do a detailed engineering analysis of the application schema and SQL, it is recommended that applications run ""PRAGMA optimize"" (with no arguments) just before closing each database connection. Long-running applications might also benefit from setting a timer to run ""PRAGMA optimize"" every few hours.\r\n> This pragma is usually a no-op or nearly so and is very fast. However if SQLite feels that performing database optimizations (such as running ANALYZE or creating new indexes) will improve the performance of future queries, then some database I/O may be done. Applications that want to limit the amount of work performed can set a timer that will invoke sqlite3_interrupt() if the pragma goes on for too long. Or, since SQLite 3.32.0, the application can use PRAGMA analysis_limit=N for some small value of N (a few hundred or a few thousand) to limit the depth of analyze. \r\n\r\nFinally, `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)`. Checkpointig is the process of moving the contents of a WAL back into the main database. Our WAL is [limited to 2mb](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/issues/1172), so we know this won\'t be a very expensive operation. But still not cheap!\r\nIn a PASSIVE mode it won\'t obtain a writer lock, so this should not trigger SQL_BUSY signals.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, I don\'t think any of these should run on startup.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:HomeScreen', 'Feature:Bookmarks']",Bookmark all open tabs to a folder (like desktop),"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Collections don't fit all use cases. I'm sure you can imagine some. I for one am a massive tab hoarder! This would be great with #10878 ;)
### What/Requirements
""Bookmark all tabs"" item below ""Save to collection"" in tab switcher menu

Once you tap on Bookmark all tabs, Firefox should ask you what you'd like to name the folder and where you'd like to put it. **This would be similar to the collection flow, the share all tabs flow and the bookmark all tabs flow on desktop.** 

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
when the above has been implemented

### Note
No idea what tapping and holding on tabs should do 
Edit: found it! #2487

Edited to remove my rant about the mixed homescreen and tab switcher which have been separated.

This would be really useful for private browsing as well as regular browsing.

"['feature request 🌟', 'b:crash', 'needs:investigation', 'eng:health', 'Feature:CrashReporting']",Create generic solution to avoid reintroducing background job crash loops,"I can't reproduce this reliably: it depends on the build having a certain type of startup crash. However, the risks are huge – essentially users are forced to uninstall – so we should mitigate.

## Steps to reproduce
- Have a startup crash of a certain type such that background tasks also fail
  - In my local build (I need a clean build), GeckoView failed to load
- Open Firefox Preview once

### Expected behavior
Firefox Preview crashes once

### Actual behavior
Firefox Preview crashes every few minutes and displays a dialog every time. This will prompt users and, given the only way to make it stop is to uninstall, will likely result in many uninstalls.

This is probably due to a background task starting on a regular basis even if it crashes.

### Device information

* Android device: ?
* Fenix version: ?

---

To be explicit, **if this is unfixed, it will be a high risk:** the user will see ""Fenix has crashed"" dialogs repeatedly, even if they're not using the app. **This may result in many uninstallations.**

Note: If it's the crash reporter restarting itself, it's unlikely we'll get those crashes – the user will probably uninstall and we'll probably never see it.

Some potential solutions, off the top of my head:
- (unsustainable) Audit anything that restarts itself (why are we restarting after a crash anyway?).
- (questionable sustainable) catch Exceptions in background tasks
- (questionable sustainable) Limit the number of times the app can restart itself

['feature request 🌟'],Bookmark archival,"Option to archive a page when adding a bookmark. i.e. send link through archive.org/archive.is/self-hosted upon bookmarking, and bookmark the archived link. Dead links are only going to increase, and exponentially so.

See third-party projects Archiveror, ArchiveBox, and Pinboard for similar, but distinct features.

Archiveror:

> Archive webpages on archive.is, archive.org and more or on your own computer in MHTML format. Automatically archive your bookmarks.

> Archiveror archives webpages online by submitting them to archive.is, archive.org, perma.cc, webcitation.org or locally by saving a copy in MHTML format on your computer. The online archives are publicly available, so you then have a backup that you can refer to in case the original falls prey to link rot.

> It preserves your bookmarks by automatically archiving them in the background. Its icon changes when you visit a bookmark it has archived, clicking on it shows the archive links. Archiving of bookmarks happens when you make a new bookmark and when you open an old bookmark. This can be disabled.

> Archiveror also makes local copies of webpages. It saves one web page in a single MHTML file. Save pages manually by either clicking the button or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+S. The filenames end with the UTC date and time of when the archive was made.

ArchiveBox:

> ArchiveBox takes a list of website URLs you want to archive, and creates a local, static, browsable HTML clone of the content from those websites (it saves HTML, JS, media files, PDFs, images and more).

> You can use it to preserve access to websites you care about by storing them locally offline. ArchiveBox imports lists of URLs, renders the pages in a headless, authenticated, user-scriptable browser, and then archives the content in multiple redundant common formats (HTML, PDF, PNG, WARC) that will last long after the originals disappear off the internet. It automatically extracts assets and media from pages and saves them in easily-accessible folders, with out-of-the-box support for extracting git repositories, audio, video, subtitles, images, PDFs, and more.","[{'user': None, 'user_id': 51363864, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'should this be left up to extensions?'}, {'user': 'John Navas', 'user_id': 14850792, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'My **[Share2Archive extension](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navasgroup.share2archive&hl=en_US)** for Android does this quickly and easily.\r\n\r\n![unnamed (Custom)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14850792/84620885-03c43200-ae8e-11ea-940e-09cacda3bd39.png)'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Add-ons work in Fennec, so does downloading, opening local files, viewing source, anchor links, and the list goes on and on and on. List of essential functions that define what a browser is and are gone or broken in Fenix. Fennec gave any Chromium-based browser a run for its money.

['feature request 🌟'],Access Devtools within the browser,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

Mobile devices are becoming more prevalent and more and more people are using them exclusively rather than laptops or desktops.

One of the cool features of web browsers, for me, has been the ability to inspect and mess around with them and see how they work under the hood. It helped get me into web development, and I've heard similar stories from a lot of people in the industry.

It'd be nice if we could start seeing dev tools within phones and get the current generation of web-users to have the same experience.

### What/Requirements

- Ability to open dev tools as a tab
- A mobile-friendly-ish UI for dev tools (The desktop version is good enough for tablets)
- An ""open dev tools button"" in the hamburger menu somewhere
- An ""inspect element"" option in the context menu when right clicking an element.
- Ability to dock dev tools while viewing the page in addition to the tab? (probably harder to get right)

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

- People will be able to debug issues with web pages / mess around with them.

1) There is no feedback when the navigation starts. We could consider showing the urlbar as soon as we detect that there will be a new out-of-scope page coming.

2) If you go further into the history (by clicking more links), it takes a lot of taps to get back to the PWA.

Switching to the -O2 flag has [pageload perf improvements](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1591725#c36), but increases apk size by ~6MB.

Need this experiment to measure tradeoffs.

### What/Requirements
- [x] Stability experimentation on 3.2 1/22-1/27 w/ GV 74 Nightly
- [ ] A/B test on Firefox Preview Release (pending Phase 1): 1/27-2/14 w/ GV 73 Beta
- [ ] Decide which version of GV to use for upcoming releases
- [ ] Update GV version in AC right before 3.3 goes out

This experiment would be run in staged rollout through Google Play, because Mako doesn't have this capability. Johan is assisting with this.
Corey from the Data Science team is involved in analyzing the results for retention.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
Data Science has results that allow us to make a perf decision.

And most of those guides are made for desktop so some preferences that work perfectly fine there might cause big problems on Android.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo the solution is that users are aware of this and that they can easily fix problems. I think that this can be done in multiple steps/ways (and more of them should be used at the same time):\r\n\r\n* Display some warning when user opened about:config (BZ-1647160). I think it would be the best to display same warning as on desktop (page which users should confirm before about:config is displayed, with ability to dismiss warning forever). This ensures users are aware bad things can happen. However, users might not actually read that warning (but this is their fault...).\r\n\r\n* Provide users a way to backup profile and preferences and restore them in case if something is completely broken (GH-2080). This makes sure that even if users ignore warning, blindly change preferences and break things, they can restore profile without losing data. However, users will still need to manually backup profile/preferences before they change them, otherwise they wouldn\'t be able to restore it. In addition to this, it might be possible (I don\'t know) that Firefox would be broken so badly that even restoring won\'t work.\r\n\r\n* Extension to previous way: Automatically backup preferences when user accesses about:config and automatically restore them from backup if something is broken (and inform users what is broken and that it was fixed using backup). Users don\'t need to do anything and they can change all preferences without too much problems. However, similar to previous way, it might be possible that they would break backup and restore system.\r\n\r\n* Prevent editing specific preferences (and inform user when they want to edit them why they are locked) which are known to cause problems (on stable, but keep them editable on beta and nightly for developers). This would be quite effective as it would ensure users won\'t be able to break things in the first place. It would also be easier to implement than backup and restore system. However, some users will then comply that they are unsable to do anything they want (in this case they can use beta or nightly) and developers would need to keep track of such preferences, otherwise this would be useless. Support for this should be added directly to GeckoView because this is where `about:config` is implemented, but there should be exposed runtime option to change which preferences are disabled, so Fenix and other GeckoView-based browsers can fix this.

Stable Chrome that ships with Android lets me go to chrome://flags, heed the warning, and break the browser if I want to. I have broken it with flags before, but guess what? I reverted them after reading documentation via another browser. So Firefox is taking an anti-user, anti-customization stance, and should think things over before shooting it's remaining users and itself in the foot. There's a much more unfiltered version of what I wanted to say. I mean no hatred of Firefox or anyone that works on it, but dang it we're not babies. I've used Firefox for some 12 years as my default and after every stupid move I want to switch to VIvaldi or something else. Take heed, developers, for ignoring users too much backfires as they switch and monetization goes down (from search deals). Mozilla is hurting now and with it's services not taking off it cannot afford to damage itself in various ways. Politicized snippets in the desktop browser are another example. Stick to making a browser and doing a good job of it. Not crippling features and dabbling with politics. It's for the best of the future of Mozilla corporation. Because corporations need revenue, derived from the consumer, to survive. I am upset for the case of the future of the company, and I don't even work there.

### What/Requirements

Ideally, in Mozilla's quest to enhance privacy it would be nice to think about what can be done to make browsers more generic. Integration with an API that reveals just how unique your browser is would be a good start, as well as making changes to make browsers/users less identifiable. 

Valve has a repo called [Fingerprint2](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2) and you can see a demo [here](https://fingerprintjs.com/demo).

I feel calling it ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" is a bit misleading if you can still be identified using a simple JS script.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:ReaderMode']",Add paged view in reading mode (vs scrolling),"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
This is a issue that concerns me since a long time. Many researches show that reading in paged view has many benefits (for example: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221342423_Eye_movement_study_of_reading_text_on_a_mobile_phone_using_paging_scrolling_leading_and_RSVP).

First of all it is less demanding for our eyes, it reduces eye strain and provides us better eye muscles movements. It also showed better and easier understanding of the text in many cases, especially for long text and articles, in which it helps highlighting and understanding paragraphs and text structure.

I think this should be default in reading mode, but it could also be added just as an option. Reading mode is mostly used for long texts, so it should provide us with the best tools to make reading as pleasing as possible and paged view is a core feature in this regard.

### What/Requirements
Add an option in reading mode to switch between paged view and scrolling.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
When in the reading mode options there will be a switch to activate paged view instead of scrolling.

That requires it to crop along the dimension that is shorter than the video. The correct approach is to check _x_ and ask, ""If I expand the video to be as wide as _x_, _y_ require cropping?"" If no, then expand video to full width of _x_ and letterbox _y_ if necessary.

If they did that on Firefox they should get a reasonable size, I\'d think. I found a quirk where outerHeight was slightly _smaller_ than `innerHeight`: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=712225.\r\n\r\nBut ok, they don\'t take the outerHeight codepath, so we go through the innerWidth + matchMedia codepath. But my phone has a fractional `devicePixelRatio` (`2.608695652173913`). So that won\'t work, we end up with `(width: 846px) and (height: 414px)`, but the real dimensions are fractional and this is `width: 846.0166625976562, height: 414`. This explains why for some people changing display scaling fixes it. Note that we tried to make `innerWidth` / `innerHeight` not round a while ago (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5260), but that didn\'t work and broke tons of websites.\r\n\r\nSo we end up falling back to `this.element.clientWidth` and `this.element.clientHeight` codepath, which is the resize that ends up being the same as chrome (but then chrome gets fixed in the subsequent resize because of the UA sniffing taking the fullscreen codepath). This would be fixed if in fullscreen they just looked at `fullscreenElement.clientWidth/clientHeight` for example.\r\n\r\nSo I think this mostly points to a youtube-side bug. I\'ll look into contacting them, and I\'ll look into the `outer{Width,Height}` bug separately.'}, {'user': 'Emilio Cobos Álvarez', 'user_id': 1323194, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'I also verified that the innerWidth / innerHeight codepath would not be taken in chrome on my device, for the same reason.'}, {'user': 'Christopher Micek', 'user_id': 16419191, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': ""It's not just YouTube, at least for me.

If you send me other links where I could possibly reproduce similar issues I can look, but so far the issue I can reproduce is the YouTube one, and that I investigated (to the best of my knowledge) above.\r\n\r\nFWIW the easiest way to investigate these is just via [`about:debugging`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging).

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Settings']","""Expire History By Days"" Type Feature Suggestion","### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

A poster on Reddit suggested I post this request here after he read a thread I started:

https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/f2nyx1/

Though an extension exists that does what I am suggesting on desktop and Fennec Firefox, it is not a Mozilla recommended extension and thus not likely to be ported, at least anytime soon, to Fenix, based on a recent announcement about extensions for the platform.

I am not sure how well maintained it is in any event.  There are some apparent bugs with its Fennec implentation, which aren't aren't worth getting into because Fennec in general is going away soon.

At least one other browser has integrated similar behavior into its core browser options (Desktop Vivaldi).  So, I thought it might make sense for Fenix to consider doing the same, perhaps even with an extra feature or two.

### What/Requirements

The desired behavior is to delete history entries on a rolling basis that fall before a user-specified number of days. For example, if you set it to 90 days, you get to keep the last 90 days of history (Calendar days, meaning days where you don't use the browser still count). Then, tomorrow, the history entries 91 days ago automatically get deleted. You can set it for any number of days.  The default would be unlimited. Users would go into the options GUI to enable it and set a desired number of days at that time.

Optionally, the same could be done with cookies, either as part of the same option, or as a separate option, which covers part of the behavior of another non-recommended unlikely to be ported extension.

The goal here is not so much privacy enhancement as to simply allow users to set a user defined time period for which they want history (and possibly more) to be retained and for old stuff to disappear on a rolling basis so it doesn't appear as a suggestion in the URL bar or when browsing through history.  Its a fresh start / live in the moment type optimization.  The user isn't unnecessarily reminded of old problems, etc., and is also able to set a time period limitation for this type of data that the user feels is manageable and makes it easiest to retain what needs to be retained without clutter.

Of course, users who suspect they won't go back to a site for longer than their defined period for deleting history but want it easily available would either bookmark the site or add it to a collection to preserve it that way.

Users who want to preserve all history as history indefinitely would simply not enable this potential option at all.


### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

Its done when Fenix has the same as, or more functionality than, the desktop ""Expire History By Days"" extension- optionally, but not necessarily, with a similar cookie management component.","[{'user': 'Kevin Brosnan', 'user_id': 250273, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'Desktop Firefox does not have expire history by days exposed in the settings.

My browser showed an interstitial page, asking if I intended to go to (actual) ""apple.com"" and not the (example) attack site.  The default button was for the well-known site, and there was a less-weighted button for ""Ignore"" (to go to the attacks site).  Know why?  **Because I wasn\'t using Firefox**.  Chrome took action to protect its users, Mozilla did not.  On Firefox for Android, the site loads immediately, and it just says Secure Connection / Verified by Let\'s Encrypt, with (quite on topic for this issue!) absolutely no way to get more details.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNow, *this* actually isn\'t relevant, but just for kicks, I pasted the same link into (desktop) Firefox:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/943160/96884150-7919c200-1481-11eb-8d70-595919094539.png)\r\n\r\nI guess it\'s Apple, right?  Click the padlock, says ""Connection Secure""; click the arrow, says ""Connected to www.apple.com"" and ""Verified by Let\'s Encrypt""; click ""More Information"", says ""www.apple.com"" (""this website does not supply ownership information"" is strange but no active red flags yet); click ""View Certificate"" and *finally* we actually see the punycode for the URL.'}, {'user': 'Andrei Petcu', 'user_id': 922368, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'I reported a separate bug since I think this is a different issue than the one discussed here https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16127 '}, {'user': 'Kevin Brosnan', 'user_id': 250273, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'This issue is not about Punnycode.

I find it confusing because
- desktop and Fennec do not do it
- it feels broken because it does not occur on every URL. For example www.bbc.co.uk gets /news appended, but arstechnica.com gets nothing appended.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search', 'Feature:AndroidIntegration']","Close keyboard and address bar in separate ""back"" presses","### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
In landscape in particular, I would sometimes press the system back button to close the keyboard so that I can see more search suggestions. Currently this both closes the keyboard and closes the address bar. If we could get this only to close the keyboard on the first press, it would be nice. I think it would also make it more consistent with other places in Android.

Also when you're just starting out and haven't opted in to search suggestions, the little introducer blocks everything and you can't scroll down to click ""Allow."" Again, that's specific to landscape mode.

### What/Requirements
- Have a way to see more suggestions when you feel like you've typed enough
- Have a way to enable suggestions in landscape mode after having typed something

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
Pressing back closes keyboard and leaves address bar open

"['🐞 bug', 'Feature:SendTab', 'S2']",[Bug] Sending tabs to multiple devices is not working without a forced sync,"## Steps to reproduce
1. Sign in with the same account on several devices, and on desktop.
2. Create a collection with one or multiple tabs.
3. Select to share the collection to all devices connected.

### Expected behavior
All the tabs from the collection are sent to all the connected devices.

### Actual behavior
The tabs are sent only on desktop.
If sync is triggered manually, the tabs are sent.

### Device information
* Android devices: Sony Xperia Z2 (Android 6.0.1), Sony Xperia Z5 Premium (Android 7.1.1), Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 (Android 8), Windows 10
* Fenix version: Beta 4.0.0-beta.1, Nightly 2/20
* Reproducible also if trying to send a tab that is not in a collection.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Telemetry']",Include the total duration of foreground use over the metrics ping measurement window in the metrics ping,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

It's often useful to understand how much time a user has spent directly interacting with the browser. Duration of foreground use is only available in the baseline ping, but essentially all other interesting metrics for experiment analysis are in the metrics ping. Having to touch another table to do the analysis makes analysis more complex and the measurement windows of baseline and metrics pings are probably not coterminal so it's probably difficult to do it in a strictly correct way.

#4456 is another example of tracking a usage metric (URI count) in the metrics ping.

### What/Requirements

The metrics ping should have something like a foreground_duration metric that describes the total foregrounded duration over the measurement window of the metrics ping.

The same is true for some of the three-dot menu items which the app specifies for us (usually the ones without an icon in front of it is indication that they came from the third-party app so we don't have an icon for it).

I knew that version 2021.02.04 worked for me before", but when I installed the version using a clean install, the issue was still there. This led me to believe my phone was causing the issue, but the default browser did work like a charm. I went all the way back to when I first reported the issue as fixed (version 2020.10.06) and it indeed worked like it should. I manually upgraded all the way to version 2021.02.01 and here is where things get interesting.\r\n\r\nA clean install of version 2020.02.01 (February 1st) works like it should. Recently downloaded files of pretty much any filetype show up in the recent files section of the default Files-app (com.android.documentsui). If I perform a clean install of version 2021.02.02 it does not work anymore. A fresh install of versions 2021.02.02 up to 2021.02.06 have the issue.\r\n\r\nBut if I upgrade from previous versions (one version at a time), it works up to 2021.02.04.

This excludes filetypes from images and videos. So every version I tested only showed pictures and videos under recent files.\r\n- When the documents (pdf, docx, apk, nzb etc...) don't get indexed, one thing stood out for me. When I download pdf files, and want to open them directly within Firefox using the notification that appears, two different PDF-readers fail to open the files, stating there is some reading error and they don't have access to the file.\r\n- I can see that around that time the issue came back, some changes have been made to actually solve the issue for other users.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Collections', 'Feature:PocketIntegration']",[Feature request] Send collection to Pocket,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
I frequently gather up collections of tabs which I want to read (they are articles, not websites to explore) and I realise that the best place for these is actually a read-it-later service, like Pocket. I tried to send a collection of tabs to Pocket but only one was added to Pocket, so it appears that I can only add tabs to Pocket one at a time, which is extremely laborious. 

### What/Requirements
When Sharing a collection to the Pocket app send each link in the collection, _or_ update Pocket to accept collections (I think the former solution is simpler, but I could be wrong).

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
When I share a collection to the Pocket app, the Pocket app receives all of the links in the collection.","[{'user': None, 'user_id': 25123631, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'Hi @eliserichards,\r\nThis is not necessarily direct Pocket integration, but that may be a solution.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search']",[Bug] Cannot install OpenSearch search plugins,"## Steps to reproduce
1. Visit any page that offers an OpenSearch search plugin, e.g. https://mycroftproject.com/search-engines.html?author=Jan+Henning
2. Install the search engine and acknowledge the confirmation popup whether you actually want to install that search engine.

### Expected behavior
The search engine is installed and I can actually use it.

### Actual behavior
The search engine *doesn't* appear in the list of available search engines.
Curiously enough, attempting to install the same search engine again does yield an ""engine with the same name already exists"" install error, though.

While I know that you can also manually create a search engine,
1. typing out a query string on a mobile is cumbersome
2. this doesn't allow specifying an icon and
3. most importantly, this doesn't allow specifying usage of a POST query - the online catalogue of my local library *doesn't* accept GET queries for example

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Sync', 'Feature:SendTab', 'a-s']",[Bug] Order of synced devices in Share should be be recently/frequently used,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Many people, like me, may have several synced devices to which we send tabs. I frequently send tabs between Fenix Nightly and a Windows 10 Firefox instance. However, the order in which the synced devices appear in the share list always shows this Win10 instance (my most common share destination) and the end of the list, so I have to sidescroll to get to it everytime.

### What/Requirements
In Fennec I believe the list of devices to send tabs to is shown based on either most frequently or most recently used (or a combination of both) - the order of the list changes when I send to less common devices, so I know there is some algorithm at work.

Please apply this algorithm in Fenix, it will save me and others a little bit of time every time we send a tab, and in total that will save a lot of time.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

The Gecko profiler allows [profiling Gecko startup](https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/./guide-remote-profiling?id=startup-profiling) with environment variables such as `MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP`. However, as far as I know, this is currently only possible in debuggable builds:
The only way I'm aware of to set these environment variables is the yaml file, e.g. `/data/local/tmp/org.mozilla.fenix.debug-geckoview-config.yaml`, as described in the [Reading configuration from a file](https://mozilla.github.io/geckoview/consumer/docs/automation#reading-configuration-from-a-file) GeckoView docs. But this yaml file is only read in debuggable Fenix builds.

This means that we currently do not have a way to do Gecko startup profiling in Fenix production builds. This means we can't get accurate results in profiles.

This issue is similar to #9231 but scoped to the Gecko Profiler. This issue is not concerned with profiling Fenix itself or Java/Kotlin code - only with profiling Gecko.

### What/Requirements

Can we add a way to do this? For example, we could read the yaml file even in production builds. Or we could ""propagate"" the respective environment variables to Gecko when they're set from e.g. `adb shell am start --es env0 MOZ_PROFILER_STARTUP=1 [...]`.
Fennec seemed to do this, i.e. when Fennec was started with such a command, startup profiling would happen.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

It should be possible to obtain Gecko startup profiles with the Gecko profiler from Fenix production builds on the Play Store.","[{'user': 'Markus Stange', 'user_id': 961291, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': ""> The only way I'm aware of to set these environment variables is the yaml file, e.g. `/data/local/tmp/org.mozilla.fenix.debug-geckoview-config.yaml`, as described in the [Reading configuration from a file](https://mozilla.github.io/geckoview/consumer/docs/automation#reading-configuration-from-a-file) GeckoView docs.

In the profile, it took around 417ms until `GeckoRuntime.create` was called. The profile is from a debuggable build, so it's exaggerating the problem a little bit, but it shows a number of things getting initialized earlier.

It's an much easier way to instantly edit a new bookmark f.e. to save it in a specific folder or to rename it.
Currently, doing this needs 4 screen interactions:
Touch to open the menu, touch the 'Add new bookmark' button, touch to open menu, touch the same button now represeting the saved bookmark to edit the bookmark.
The goal is an intuitive way of editing your new bookmark quickly requiring only half the steps:
Touch to open the menu, long-press the 'Add new bookmark' button.

### What/Requirements
New action that happens when long-pressing the not filled 'Bookmark' (star) button:
- Adding the current site to bookmarks as well as
- opening the 'Edit bookmark' view for that new bookmark.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Sharing', 'needs:UX-investigation']",Change share menu to vertically-scrolling menu.,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

Horizontally-scrolling menus that don't use the full-height of the screen is a user-hostile design on mobile devices. It takes more effort to horizontally scroll than to vertically scroll when the menu doesn't use full screen height. It also increases the cognitive burden of selecting an application to share to because the UX paradigm is too dissimilar from the norm (see below). 

Share menus on the Android platform are typically vertically-scrolling ""bottomsheets"", even when applications are using a custom menu rather than the native share menu. Users expect a similar menu when sharing in Firefox.

### What/Requirements

Change the menu to be vertically scrolling rather than horizontally scrolling.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search']",Shortcut to the start page of selected search engine,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
The user receives a nice little feature without changing the surface of the UI making it more complicate. The look of the UI is not affected, neither its design or clarity.
It enables to easily access the start page of the most used websites, allowing to get further functionality and services of that website. For example:
- on 'google.com' you can tap the apps icon to change to any of Google's services, like Maps, Translator, Drive... or you can just manage your accounts.
- Another good use is disabling search suggestions in the address bar but still having a quick way to receive search suggestions if needed in particular cases.

### What/Requirements
<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61639215/77600043-f048a100-6f06-11ea-85dd-0f7ab07ec58e.jpg"" width=""40"">
The icon of the selected search engine in the address bar should become a button that leads to the start page of that search engine.

**Details**
The icon of the currently selected search engine is displayed on the left side of the address bar whenever it acts as a search bar. That's the case in different scenarios:
- on the tabs page:
![20200326_021248](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61639215/77600395-1ae72980-6f08-11ea-9c3c-8471f1b0fa97.jpg)
- typing in the address bar to open a new tab from the tabs page (either by touching the address bar or the 'New tab' / '+' button):
![20200326_021703](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61639215/77600368-03a83c00-6f08-11ea-9f99-ecf8ef8dcaf3.jpg)

In both cases above tapping the icon should open the start page in a new tab.
- editing the address bar from the current tab in order to change to a different website:
![20200326_021955](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61639215/77600457-4e29b880-6f08-11ea-94e1-1ac14c5f1abd.jpg)

In the case above tapping the icon should open the start page in the current tab.
- In every other case, you are viewing a website and at the exact same position of the search engine icon is the 'Shield' icon from the 'Enhanced Tracking protection' button:
![20200326_022201](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61639215/77600572-9ea11600-6f08-11ea-8a5b-a2fdc95bca09.jpg)
The search engine icon as a button should receive the same animation when touching it as the 'Enhanced Tracking Protection' button has. Appart from the animation, it shouldn't look any different as to right now.

To get the address of the start page of a search engine the same link can be used as when searching, simply leaving the search query string ""%s"" empty:

"['feature request 🌟', 'eng:ready', 'Feature:Search']",Keep keyboard open while scrolling search engines,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Keeping the keyboard open is a more efficient and intuitive behaviour for the user. It saves one unnecessary step (reopening the keyboard) and looks better.
- Touching a search engine doesn't close the keyboard, only changing search engines by scrolling and then tapping the desired one does.
- This behaviour can be disturbing disturbing and doesn't look smooth. The fact that the keyboard closes in the middle of scrolling can cause the view to jump, in case it is possible to scroll search engines with the keyboard open but they will fit on the screen after it is closed. It will no more be possible to scroll and elements will be placed at their default positions.

### What/Requirements
Keep the keyboard open while scrolling search engines and don't lose focus of the address bar.

- scroll down

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Bookmarks']",Set default bookmark location,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
I use the desktop Firefox's bookmarks toolbar as the main folder for my bookmarks. This is fine for desktop Firefox, as it gives me quick access to my bookmarks, but creates unneeded steps (like navigating through a longer folder structure) in mobile Firefox, i.e. Fenix. Allowing users to set a default bookmarks folder when tapping the ""Bookmarks"" option in the Library would grant them quicker access to their bookmarks, in case they don't use the default folder in Fenix.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:CustomTabs', 'Feature:WebExtensions']",Either UBO should not be active in Custom Tabs or there should be an option to disable it in the Custom Tab,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Many websites have implemented anti-adblock techniques that make that website unusable for those using UBO. While this can be circumvented using certain filterlists, for the average user the easiest way is to simply disable UBO for that website. Currently UBO is active on custom tabs but there is no option to disable it there. So if someone were to open such a page in custom tabs, they would be unable to access it and would have to open in Firefox and then disable UBO for it to work. 
### What/Requirements
Since such a method is needlessly time consuming (2x the load time + some links may be one time use only) a better method is to give the option to disable UBO,(and presumably other addons) within a custom tab

"['🐞 bug', 'eng:qa:verified', 'Feature:Snackbar', 'S2']",[Bug] Can't Use Address Bar while Snackbar is Displayed,"## Steps to reproduce
**Scenarios**
This bugs only occurs for specific snackbars, not for all. From what I've found out, the bug occurs at least for these two:
- ""URL copied to clipboard"" snackbar
    - go to a website
    - tap and hold the address on the address bar
    - tap 'Copy' to copy the address
- ""Deleted «top-level domain»"" snackbar
    - go to a website
    - save it as a bookmark
    - edit the saved bookmark
    - delete the bookmark
- try to tap the address to edit it or try to tap another button on the address bar

The bug does not take effect for these snackbars:
- ""Bookmark saved! 'EDIT'"" snackbar
- ""New tab opened 'SWITCH'"" snackbar
- ""Tab closed 'UNDO'"" snackbar
- ""Added to top sites!"" snackbar

### Expected behavior
After copying the address, the confirmation snackbar is displayed saying ""URL copied to clipboard"".
It's displayed above the address bar without overlapping it. So the address bar is fully accessible in theory. Tapping the address field is supposed to open the keyboard to edit the URL and tapping other buttons on the address bar should trigger the right action, too.

### Actual behavior
The address bar is not useable while the confirmation snackbar ""URL copied to clipboard"" is displayed. There is no reaction to tapping anywhere on the address bar.

The ""Share"" option (added in commit f569f48b335 to resolve issue #5696) is the very last item in the Context Menu. This makes it inconvenience to access, requiring one to press the three-button menu and scroll down through an overflow menu past many items, including third-party app additions (Image A below).

"['feature request 🌟', 'needs:gecko', 'Feature:IME']",Better UX for editing textareas,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

Text areas suck, inputting any nontrivial amount of text (such as filling in this ""feature request"" template on github) takes about 3x - 5x longer than it would on desktop. I find this is primarily because moving the cursor around to edit text often results in the text input scrolling belatedly and my taps end up going not where I expect them, etc.

### What/Requirements

Concrete suggestion I have to improve this is to provide a mechanism for the user to ""pop out"" the textarea into a fullscreen native Android text input widget, and allow them to do their edits there. Once done, they can ""submit"" to return to the webpage, and the stuff they inputted in the native widget gets pasted back into the textarea. The mechanism could be accessible by long-pressing the textarea, or maybe via an icon added in one of the corners or something.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

Inputting a nontrivial amount of text into a textarea is no worse in the browser than it is in other native apps.","[{'user': 'Kevin Brosnan', 'user_id': 250273, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'A lot of this behavior is defined by Gecko. @makotokato might have some ideas'}, {'user': 'Kartikaya Gupta (kats)', 'user_id': 485789, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': ""I don't think this can be fixed on the Gecko side, because Gecko has to confirm to various web platform expectations (e.g. sizing to what the content author specifies) that is inherently user-unfriendly.

"['feature request 🌟', 'needs:product', 'Feature:Privacy&Security', 'S2', 'Feature:Logins']",[User Story] 3rd party password manager apps support,"## Notes
This is a follow up with the current situation regarding more password manager apps.
Initial [bug](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/87) closed now.

## User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to use the password manager apps.

## Dependencies
Most popular password manager apps:
- [ ] [My passwords - Password Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.er.mo.apps.mypasswords&hl=en)
- [ ] [LastPass Password Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid&hl=en)
- [x] [Password Safe - Secure Password Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reneph.passwordsafe&hl=en)
- [ ] [Password Manager SafeInCloud](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword&hl=en)
- [x] [1Password - Password Manager and Secure Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safeincloud.free&hl=en)

- [x] [Password Keeper (Black Berry](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.callpod.android_apps.keeper&hl=en)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Password manager app can access Fenix
- [ ] Fenix fills out logins automatically
- [ ] Fenix fills out logins automatically after the password manager app was changed
- [ ] Focus app parity

Below I will update the table once I will move forward with the testing and I will add information regarding what issues need to be fixed/investigated if it will be the case to contact the password manager apps developers.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Media', 'needs:UX-investigation']",improve discoverability of picture-in-picture feature,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem

The picture-in-picture feature is an awesome feature but it's really hard to discover.

At the moment you have to start a video in the fullscreen mode and then you have to switch to your Android home screen to trigger the PiP feature. I noticed Chrome does the same so it's probably good enough for a first implementation.

But I, as a user, neither understand the relation between the fullscreen mode and picture-in-picture mode nor would I have ever thought of the idea that I have to switch to the Android home screen in combination with the previous step to enable this feature.

My hypothesis is that the feature would be much more discoverable if it wouldn't depend on the fullscreen feature.

### What/Requirements

There are different options. Firefox on desktop shows a small overlay over the video to enable the PiP feature. A similar solution would be great from a cross platform consistency POV. A context menu would be another option.

/cc @ekager because you worked on the feature.

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)

The feature has to be easier to discover.","[{'user': 's-ankur', 'user_id': 33252312, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'Related #11408'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Media', 'Feature:Gesture', 'S3']",[Bug] Consider adding pinch-out (i.e. zoom out) to unfullscreen fullscreen videos,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
To unfullscreen a video, users have two options:
1. Click the fullscreen button provided by the video player
2. Swipe down from the very top of the screen and click the back button, which is provided by the Android system

However, 1 can be a problem if the website does not provide the controls or makes them difficult to use (e.g. https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/9939). 2 is not very discoverable.

### What/Requirements
In Firefox for Echo Show, we implemented a ""pinch-out"" (i.e. zoom out)  to exit fullscreen. The video would shrink with the pinch gesture and when the user released, fullscreen would be exited. Here [is a video sample](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile-skunkworks/firefox-connect/files/2559634/device-2018-11-07-151630.mp4.zip) (note that the video is less smooth than on-device because video capture has overhead).

This is likely more discoverable than 2 and more convenient than 1. Users might actually prefer this way to exit fullscreen than existing functionality.

This may be difficult/impossible to implement because:
- GeckoView may not support resizing the video
- If a user is doing a fullscreen game rather than a video, the pinch gesture may override game functionality. We really can only do this on videos

Context: we implemented this in FFES https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-echo-show/issues/75 because system option 2 did not exist so sites could do a denial of service attack on Firefox users.

"['🐞 bug', 'needs:gv', 'Feature:Toolbar']",[Bug] Top dynamic toolbar does not properly scroll when going from 0 scroll flags to set on first scroll,"The suggested solution is to refactor our code to use `MotionLayout`.

1. Add option on tab swipe (as it behaves with deleting tabs) to move private tab to the home screen.
1. Longpress on tab with possible multi selection and move tab(s) over a menu.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:History']",Separate clear history from site data,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
Firefox Beta for Android can be configured to clear certain items on exit. History and site data are a single checkbox so I am not given the choice to clear history but keep site data.

### What/Requirements
I use sites that store local data so I can use it again next time without any cookies or sign in. I don't want to store a history but I do want the data I typed into that site.
Example is https://ac-turnip.com/ 

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
Separate checkboxes for history and site data.","[{'user': 'Matt McCutchen', 'user_id': 8885753, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': 'I have the opposite use case: keep history (so I can find things again if I didn\'t think to bookmark them) and clear site data that might be used to track me across sessions.

Workaround in the meantime (for my rooted phone), which I just tested and it seems to work:\r\n\r\n1. Force stop Firefox and back up `/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/places*`.  (Since an SQLite database can consist of a variable number of files and mixing and matching them can corrupt the database, it\'s important to delete _all_ `places*` files from the destination before copying whatever files currently exist on the source, and likewise on restore.  I have a widget on the home screen that runs a script in the jackpal terminal that does `su` to the app user and changes to the app SELinux context before manipulating the files; I can provide more details if anyone is interested.)\r\n2.

As a user with a lot of open tabs, I want to be able to easily locate the last tab I was on and re-order tabs in a way that fits my needs, so I don't have to spend time looking for a specific tab.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Tabs']",Tab Switcher icon should be present on Tab tray; tapping it should go back to page,"Clarifying this request:

* Toolbar is still visible when drawer is open so user can quick tap to open/close drawer

### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
As a user who sometimes wants to glance at open pages (but not switch) or change my mind to change to a new tab, I would like to easily go back to where I was by tapping the same button that brought me to the tab tray, like I can in Chrome or Opera. I also don't need to move my finger/hand to a farther area of the screen than I had initially tapped on. 

### What/Requirements
* Tab switcher (box with number of tabs listed inside it) is present in in the tab tray in the same position as in the toolbar. 
* Tapping the tab switcher button in the tab tray takes the user back where they were previously

### Acceptance Criteria (how do I know when I’m done?)
Tab switcher appears on tab tray, tapping it closes the tab tray and takes the user back to the page they were browsing previously.

Perhaps not things you are experiencing (the top toolbar in Fenix, the tablet UI in Fennec) but they exist. \r\n\r\nLastly and more disconcertingly, the Fenix approach is far worse even in the optimal case than Fennec due to https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/10368 - in Fenix, it merely *looks* like you are opening a new tab with the double tap action, but in reality, it is more of a ""+..."" action, meaning a ""new tab if you complete the steps to open a page"". \r\n\r\nThis takes *way* longer than actually just opening a tab and any time savings you may have achieved over #10374 is gone by the time you end up entering a url or search query vs. simply opening a new tab. \r\n\r\nOf course, you can do #10374 without doing this issue, but I would continue to posit that the issues (double tap not possible with top toolbar) and consistency benefits (toggle in Android navigation, this is used widely in other Android browsers) make this worth it.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that there is a real benefit to this being a toggle - imagine if doing `alt-tab/command-tab` twice in your OS caused a new application to appear instead of switching back and forth between the applications you were using - not doing this feels like the promotion of a fairly esoteric power user feature over a benefit to general users to have interfaces that are predictable and forgiving. \r\n\r\n""Oh, I tapped this switcher icon and I just want to go back where I was... oh, I can just tap the same icon again to go back.""\r\n\r\nI think the power user feature is catered to with the long press personally, and it should become pretty natural for those users pretty quickly - I use the long press to copy URLs out of the address bar all the time now, and I miss it when using another browser. \r\n\r\nI would also bet that the long press action is more accessible (and faster) than asking the user to select the tab switcher, wait for the items on tab tray to be enumerated, then performing the new tab action -- the new tab action is built directly into the switcher instead of opening a whole new panel where the new tab icon happens to be in the same place (in the bottom toolbar mode!) as the tab switcher.

As a user, I would like to easily find relevant related information about historical data I have created (what used to be in my Library (see https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/10343) in a discoverable way that doesn't feel cumbersome like the Library did.

"['🐞 bug', 'S3', 'Feature:WebExtensions']","[Bug] ""Last updated"" date in addon details view is not the date of the last update","## Steps to reproduce
1. Install an older version of uBlock Origin. For example by installing a Fennec-based version of Firefox Beta to install uBlock Origin 1.18.6 and then upgrading to the Fenix-based version of Firefox Beta.
1. Visit Addons > uBlock Origin > Details
1. Look at the ""Last updated"" date.

### Expected behavior
The shown date should match the last updated date of the version that I had installed, e.g. Mar 13, 2019 for version 1.18.6. This date should be provided by GeckoView (which should take the date from from the `updateDate` field of addon objects from the AddonManager internals).

If the user had not installed any version, showing the date of the most recent update should be fine.

Note: from the details view it was not obvious that an update of a newer version was available. To address that, consider adding two extra rows, ""Latest version"" + ""Latest update at"", after ""Version""  /""Last updated"".

### Actual behavior
It shows ""May 7, 2020"". This is not what I expected, and not even the date of the most recent version (1.26.2 = Apr 16, 2020). This date seems to directly be derived from the response from AMO (and I filed a bug report for the incorrect `last_updated` date at https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/14209).

### What/Requirements
Multi Container, Seccomp-BPF with TSYNC, isolated app renderers, and SELinux.
these Requirements same as linux because android have linux kernel.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Media', 'S3']",[Feature request] Stop GIFs from automatically playing to save mobile internet data,"### Why/User Benefit/User Problem
As I have seen most of the time GIFs are very large files and they start to load automatically thus they consume a lot of Mobile internet data whether the user wants to play them or not, just today I lost about 250 MB of data in just a few seconds as I didn't know the page contained such large amounts of GIF files. I think there should be a switch or a default behaviour to turn off the autoplay of GIF files as the mobile internet is expensive most of the time. In a sense they are just like the auto-playing videos for me. 

You could provide a play button for playing GIF files individually instead of playing them automatically.

As a user, I want to keep some types of browsing activity completely separate from others, so I can conveniently accomplish all types of tasks in the same browser without worrying about privacy. 

As a user, I want to be able to to log into a domain using multiple accounts on the same browser, so I don't have to switch browsers or use multiple browsers to manage my multiple accounts/identities. 

As a user, I want the option of having extra privacy and separation for chosen sites by default, so I don’t have to think about it every time or switch to another privacy browser in order to open those specific sites.

1. Choose French in language settings (but it could happen with other languages, I haven't tested)
1. Read something where you can enable reader mode. For example, let's take [Apache License v2](https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).
1. Go to appearance settings
    1. Expected behavior
The ""Sans serif"" and ""Serif"" text should be in one line (like with english version), or at least (if it's not possible because the word is too long) not have a word broken in two lines like
""Sans
seri
f""
English:

### Actual behavior
In French, empattement = serif.
We have
""Sans
empattemen
t""
and
""Empatteme
nt""

As a user, I would like to maintain context when viewing bookmarks in Fenix, especially if I am a switcher where this is a common feature. 

### What/Requirements
1. When I open the bookmarks menu item, I am taken to the last bookmark folder I had viewed
1. Fixing https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/10462 so that users do not have to descend back to the root of bookmarks when exiting bookmarks

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Voice']","Use offline voice transcription on Pixels, in Gboard","### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
* increased speed and decreased latency when using voice

privacy concerns over voice exist: 

* https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/28/apple-apologizes-for-listening-to-siri-conversations.html
* https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50048144

### Who will benefit from it?
* people on spotty networks
* people who prefer not to use online speech recognition 
* pixel owners

- - -
This is the underlying feature: https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/an-all-neural-on-device-speech.html

FWIW, this already seems to work on my device (I disabled network connectivity and said something), so the only things that need to change are:

* remove toast when using Google voice input that says voices are being sent online
* ensure that voices are _not_ being sent online
* prefer that voices are not sent online when Gboard is enabled and offline voice transcription is available
* a toggle that disables _online_ transcription 

There are a lot of moving pieces here, but I think that it is worth improving privacy and speed for Pixel owners when available.

Not sure if we want to change the default or if we\'d want to support custom throbbers in a-c but it seemed like an interesting proposal.\r\n\r\nHere is the apk poc - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C0pkRlUgvQ_3ieOlWz5PUs0_J5NEYLdG/view\r\n\r\nAnd here it is in action - ![customFenixThrobber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11428869/83107320-bb9fc400-a0c6-11ea-9954-6e7a28bbc45e.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome notes I took:\r\n- using PNGs/GIFs as throbber resources might not be the best option → app size will increase considerably. Default throbber in Android is a simple rounded arrow drawn in code that is then rotated as needed.\r\n  - I used the same technique for our arrow - drawn it in code\r\n  - I used the provided GIF (still 2MB in size) for the ""stage 2"" - indefinite rotating throbber\r\n  - I also drawn in code the shadow\r\n\r\n- For the circle arrow (stage 1):\r\n  - Default behavior is for it to translate down, increase alpha from #4C to #FF, and rotate around 540 degrees. I kept this behavior but we can customize it if needed.\r\n  - Since I went with drawing the arrow myself I used colors picked with a drawing tool, will need the exact color codes. In the above poc I\'ve used:\r\n    - start color: #FF7153\r\n    - end color: #FA1F6B\r\n\r\n- For the fenix logo used as indefinite throbber (stage 2):\r\n  - would need to reduce it\'s size\r\n    - it is very complex to be drawn in code, can\'t do the same as with the arrow from above\r\n    - first step would be to remove it\'s background (background can be easily added in code underneath the image)\r\n    - reduce it\'s padding (I\'ve used ""stage 2 / option 1 / lightmode.gif"" which has a transparent padding. I think we\'d ideally only want what is now the white padding.)\r\n    - for other complex animations we\'ve used Lottie (https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android). Maybe we could use the same here\r\n  - transitioning from the arrow to this logo might seem forced. To me it seems like is a big difference. We can think of transitions / fade effects? but these would take time that we do not have (hopefully).\r\nUser drags the throbber down and if there\'s enough slop when he releases it we change the throbber to show the fenix logo while the page is loading.\r\nIdeally the page would load in a snap so there would be little time for users to see the fenix logo in action, even less if we are come up with some transitions.\r\n\r\nRegarding performance concerns, I haven\'t profiled this but page loading would happen in GV  asynchronously from this client animation so I think this shouldn\'t cause issues but should definitely be profiled to know exactly what the impact is.

When a user has many bookmarks, these can get hidden in subfolders, or just lost in large folders. While browsing these, a user might see one bookmark that they want to open, but they still haven't found the bookmark they were looking for - currently, the user would need to open that bookmark then navigate back to the same subfolder and scroll point - therefore they would benefit from this feature

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Notifications']",Web Push notifications should be more noticeable,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
Push notifications should get the attention of users. Android has various ways to do this: heads-up notifications, notification LEDs and vibrations. Notification can also be displayed on the lockscreen.

Unfortunately, Fenix right now uses extremely conservative notification settings (no sound, vibration, or notification light), so that notifications are unlikely to be noticed by users and in some configurations are not even displayed on the lockscreen.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
I'm working on a web application that utilizes push notifications. Fenix' current implementation is practically useless: I want to notify users for auditing purposes and give them a chance to react to specific security events. Users need to react quickly to these events, but that obviously won't work if they won't ever notice the notifications.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Browsing']",[Feature Request] add the ability to scroll the text in the address bar to solve the amount of text visible in the adress bar due to #11045,"The issue #11045 introduces problem of shortened amount of text visible in the adress bar and to add to this when Fenix  starts to support Containers this will add another [icon](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/6429) to the  adress bar 

Having the Reader Mode button in the adress bar is intuitive, I can confirm that I have rarely used it or even forgot it's even there. Having it in the address bar will definitely make me use it more instead of having it in the toolbar menu. But I also agree that it'll make text shown in the address bar even shorter.

As for the Open in app I don't think this button should be moved to the adress bar as the Open in app already opens the links in the their respective apps. 
In Chrome browser this is how it works: I click a supported link let's say a Wikipedia article, this'll open the the article in the Wikipedia app (if the open in app setting is enabled) and if I don't want to open the link the Wikipedia app then I'll have to long press the link and open it in another tab, this works really well. And as I have intentionally opened the link in another tab as to not open it in the Wikipedia app I'll know that I have to manually open the link in Wikipedia app by clicking the open in app button in the toolbar menu. 

But the default behaviour of Fenix is to not open the links in apps, and Open in app button has to be shown, in this case developers can add a functionality to scroll the text horizontally to view the whole website adress.

• **_Only show the open in app button in the adress bar when user hasn't enabled the Open in app setting and hide it when the Open in app setting is enabled by the user._**

• **_And to solve the amount of text visible in the adress bar due the Reader Mode button; add the ability to scroll the text.

In [our performance analysis](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/7512#issuecomment-641621240), we determined the tabs tray appears quickly enough but **the tabs take a long time to appear.** The duration they take to appear seems to at least somewhat tied to the number of tabs opened. **On a GS5 with 8 open tabs, we're at 462ms,** about 212ms longer than we want to be.

We should improve the performance of the async tab loading.

Speculation: perhaps the tabs take so long to appear because they're blocking on getting the tab previews before loading the tabs. If not, I'd expect loading tabs to be fast because it's just a bunch of strings.

If so, this is a problem: it'll get very unperformant with a large number of open tabs. We should load the tabs and asynchronously fetch the tab when they're needed.

1. Open the Tabs Tary
1. Tap any other open tab
1. Open the Tabs Tary
1. Tap and open another tab
1. Open the Tabs Tary
1. Swipe delete the first 3 open tabs 

### Expected behavior
Steps 4,6: Responsive Tabs Tray, displays properly the open tabs

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:IME']",a way to change the emoji font for non-root users,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
Android users who don't root (but hopefully not brick) their device (void their warranty, lock themselves out of using their bank / insurance app, etc), cannot change their device's fonts, including emoji fonts

as currently it has no effect to specify the fully qualified path of a font in `font.name-list.emoji`, perhaps Firefox should offer to ""install"" a downloaded font in its own font cache?

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
emoji are how we convey emotion on the internet.
if all you feel is disgust and despair and disappointment when opening the emoji tab on your keyboard, or seeing an emoji in an app or a website, that's really not a good start.

### Who will benefit from it?
anyone who doesn't have root on their android phone

everyone who has feelings but trouble expressing them on the Internet since Google killed off their favourite emoji font

Since the functionality is already there, this should be relatively easy to add (be it by allowing the installation of XPIs manually, or through a permanent option in `web-ext`).

Of course, this is not the same as Fenix being ready for general consumer extension support. This is for extended testing, not ready for the general public.

Actually I don't like this whole new Tabtray thing and would prefer the option as before with the new tab page opening with the open tabs after the pinned sites and before the collections.

"['🐞 bug', 'Feature:ContextMenu', 'qa-triaged']","[webcontent] Text selection is buggy, especially for sites with custom text editors","Sorry if I explain this badly, my technological volcab is basically non-existent.

### Site with issue and any steps to reproduce
Sites which this affects: github.com (when creating this issue!) crypt.ee/docs (Cryptee has a text editor but its unusable due to the way Firefox selects text), reddit.com (when commenting), and others. Seems to be any site which allows custom text formatting.

Examples:
![SM-G955F](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63871973/83947758-eac5dc00-a810-11ea-8118-11356e20af8f.gif)UNITO-UNDERSCORE!20200606-161225!

In both examples it works eventually, but only after long pressing multiple times. Usually its worse than this!

### Expected behavior
Text is selected, like in other browsers

### Actual behavior
Double tapping on text shows 2 options: Paste, Select All
Long pressing on text does nothing.

### Does toggling Tracking Protection fix the issue? (Press the lock icon in the toolbar while on the site to see toggle) no
### Can you reproduce in [Firefox for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)?
Yes, any firefox android browser acts the same, with the exception of Focus which i haven't tried.

### Can you reproduce in Chrome (or other non-Mozilla browser)? No, it's completely unique to Firefox. 
### Device information
* Android device: 9

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Logins']",Autofill option in text selection toolbar,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
In other apps, fields that can be auto-filled using android (credentials) auto fill have an ""Autofill"" item in the text selection toolbar. This allows a user to trigger the autofill app, even if it is not showing up on its own. I would think having it on every password type text input would be simple enough and be comparable to the native behavior.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
As other issues point out, getting the auto fill prompt from your third party password manager is not always reliable. I am sure there's a bunch of issues to blame here, but as a user I'm used to not always getting the prompt automatically and have found that I can use the ""Autofill"" action to still trigger the prompt. Sadly Firefox Preview only offers me Paste, so I have to leave Firefox preview, open the password manager app and copy the credentials.

### Who will benefit from it?
Any user using a third party password manager that has reliability issues.

Currently Fenix adds new tabs to the top but chance it so that it adds the new tabs one after the other in a downwards direction like how Chrome does it.

Now if you ask me which one I prefer I don't know. I have been using Fenix since it launched from early last year and I haven't had any problems navigating through tabs. Perhaps a switch to change the direction could be added to satisfy the both types of users and since tab navigation is one of the central features of a browser this should be a customisable behaviour.

I would like to be able to collapse my synced tabs per device so that I can more quickly find the tab I am looking for (if I know which device it exists on). 

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
Right now, I have to scroll past devices that may not be interesting to me. This makes this feature annoying to use since it is an inefficient use of my time.

Anyone using multiple sync devices and the synced tabs UI.

Users should be able to open all of their synced tabs in Fenix in order to quickly restore a session from another device.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
My Pixel is getting replaced due to a hardware issue. I want to maintain my user data from my previous device, and https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/2080 is not yet a feature. Google restores also don't restore my session from the cloud.

The closest feature to restore my tabs from my old device is sync, but it is extremely cumbersome to tap 3 times for every tab I want to migrate. I have over 100 tabs in my old device, so that at a minimum, 300 taps on my screen along with the sheer inefficiency of the process.

Anyone who wants to migrate their existing session to a new device.

['pin'],Set accessibility focus on selected tab in TabsAdapter,"When we draw the view holder items, we do not set the selected tab with accessibility focus. We can probably fix this by passing the `isSelected` flag into the `Tab` of the view holder. Then, when the view is attached, we can request focus on it. Without knowing the selected tab, we have to do some awkward checks first:

```kotlin
override fun onViewAttachedToWindow(holder: TabViewHolder) {
    val tabs = tabs ?: return super.onViewAttachedToWindow(holder)

    val isSelected = holder.tab?.id == tabs.list[tabs.selectedIndex].id

    if (isSelected) {

"['feature request 🌟', 'needs:strings', 'Feature:SitePermissions']",need more site permissions settings,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
We need more option in the site permissions control like other chromium browsers such as brave/edge/chrome. Currently only 5 items are there in fenix limiting power to the user. Can you add more controls like chromium browsers? Brave has 19 items in the site settings menu. Attaching one screenshot. 

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
Chromium based browsers have more controls on the site permissions settings giving more flexibility to the users. Firefox main moto is giving more flexibility and powers to the user. Here also we want the same :blush:

All users

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Download']",[Feature request] Add Multi-threaded/Parallel downloads feature to the built-in download manager,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
Multi-threaded downloads divide the file into a number of parts lets say 3 or more and by doing so the download manager downloads each part as if it was a seperate download instance so the download speed gets improved quite a lot. Usually this type feature is found in third-party download managers like [ADM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dv.adm) but Chrome has also added this feature, You can read about it in this article from [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-parallel-download-accelerate-download-speeds/). 

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
When downloading bigger files and sometimes even smaller files servers sometimes limit/reduce the download speeds and if this feature is added this will definitely speed up the file downloads. 

### Who will benefit from it?
Users who download large files will definitely benefit from this feature. And others will also benifit from it since it offers increased download speeds.

When adding a custom search engine to Fenix, one can only insert a GET URL. Allowing the use of a POST URL with a compatible search engine (such as Startpage) would improve user privacy.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?

"['🐞 bug', 'Feature:RequestDesktopSite', 'S2']",[Bug] Desktop site option not remembered when page has to be reloaded,"## Steps to reproduce
1 open a new tab for www.theverge.com (or any website)

2 switch the option to request desktop site and wait for it to fully load 

3 open and browse on other tabs enough so when you come back to the verge tab it has to be reloaded and rendered again (I guess it depends on how much ram the device has).

### Expected behavior
Site is reloaded in desktop version.

### Actual behavior
Site is reloaded in mobile version, with the desktop site option enabled visually and when you try to disable it it reloads the page still in mobile version and remains visually enabled, preventing you from loading the desktop version at all.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Notifications', 'needs:UX-investigation']",Provide android notification channels for each push subscription domain,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
There is currently no way for users to give individual importance for web notifications from different domains. All web notifications have the same importance / priority.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
Having more than one push subscription from different sites can become somewhat annoying. Since I can not distinguish between the origins of the notifications without looking at them, there is no way to determine if a new notification is important to me at the moment.

"['feature request 🌟', 'needs:product']","Suggestion: Hide advanced settings in developer options (about:config, sideloading, etc.)","### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
Currently there are ongoing discussions between users and developers about which Fenix channels should receive what features (e. g. [about:config](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/7865), [sideloading](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/11308)). To solve these issues and make advanced features available in every Fenix branch, I want to suggest the addition of (hidden) developer options, where the user is able to toggle these features on or off. Other browsers, e. g. Chromium, and the Android operating system itself already have hidden developer options, so this is a familiar feature for advanced Android users already and as far as I know these features have not caused damage to normal users of said programs.
These settings should at least include an option to enable about:config. Ideally there should also be preferences for enabling unsigned extension sideloading and some kind of debugging features (if needed).

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
There is a certain demand for advanced configuration options and features, which you can see in several issues across this issue tracker. Even though these features might not be useful for most users, they are an integral part for many Firefox fans, advanced and long-time users (which also recommend browsers to less tech-savvy people) and this functionality has existed for years already on Android (Fennec). It helps to make the migration smoother for all groups of users and prevents certain people from no longer upgrading their Firefox browser on Android or switching to other browsers that offer missing functionality (→ loosing more marketshare).
It also enables the possibility to revert about:config entries, which had been changed in Fennec, after upgrading to Fenix.

### Who will benefit from it?
Anyone with needs that exceed the needs of the average Firefox user and anyone that can't use Fenix because of missing preferences or walled gardens.

['feature request 🌟'],"[New Feature] Report clickbait sites ,Protect user privacy","### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
There are lots of websites that post clickbait content, thereby wasting users time. Some also transfer spyware to the devices.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
Because I have been facing this problem for many years. Many people use mobiles for doing payments and saving private info. The spyware if installed compromises the privacy of the concerned individual.

### Who will benefit from it?
Everyone

### Possible Solution
Users can have the option to report a site to firefox. Then based on data and algorithm other firefox users can be given the warning to turn back.
Eg - Truecaller is using the method to identify spam callers and reduce fraud.

"['🐞 bug', 'Feature:Toolbar', 'Feature:Gesture']",[Bug] Separate scroll action from top bar animation,"## Steps to reproduce
1. Open any scrollable website.
1. With top bar option enabled, make quick swipes (scroll top/bottom)
1. The top bar animation takes some initial acceleration from the page content.
1. It is required to make second swipe to begin to scroll with expected and smooth acceleration.

### Expected behavior
The scrolling with the top bar enabled shall be smooth with the first swipe. The scrolling with the bottom bar enabled works well from the first swipe.

### Actual behavior
The animation of the top bar appearance shall be independent from the scrolling of the main content, as the ""energy"" of the first quick swipe is suppressed by this animation. The scrolling looks laggy. It requires to make the second swipe.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Download', 'S4']",[Feature req] Cloud download / Save to cloud,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
Users should have the option of saving the files directly to the cloud, rather than only saving it to their device. This eases accessing the files on different devices of the same account easily as well sharing it to others without dependence on uploading speed.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
It is important as 5g has arrived. The future is here, the future is about cloud computing where everything is connected to it via internet.
It is the reason why many multinationals are heavily investing in the cloud.

### Who will benefit from it?
Everyone, all the users who
*use firefox on more one device
*need more storage space on their device to access the file than they have.
*want to view the file temporarily without saving it on their phone.

### Suggestion 
Users should be given the option to connect any cloud of their choice like google drive, drop box, one drive etc. (This may as well help in generating revenue for Mozilla)

### Intent of this idea
To make Fenix more user-friendly and future-ready.

1. Open a website with an input element, e.g. https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues
1. Select the input element (keyboard appears)
1. Switch to another tab or app

### Expected behavior
The keyboard should appear again, as can be reproduced in Fennec.

### Actual behavior
The keyboard does not appear. The input element on GitHub seems to still be in focus based on the visual feedback (blue outline/glow). This might be related to #10229.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Search', 'Feature:QRCode']",QR Scanner Shortcut,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
As a user I'm looking for a fast way to experience the content behind a qr-code. Having a shortcut on my home screen (android launcher) that takes me directly into the qr-code scanner, so I can quickly browse to the target of the qr-code, would be very convenient.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
It takes a couple of steps to scan a qr-code and that increases the friction of opening the link behind a qr-code.

### Who will benefit from it?
Anyone that scans qr-codes.

I like the new design but it it feels inconsistent. If you can swipe down to close the menu why can't you swipe up to open it?

It would make the app easier to use because you won't have to aim for the tab button and it would feel more natural with the gestures.

Gestures will become very common on Android no matter how much we resist. Of course. there are a lot of use cases for 3 button Android navigation layout and that's reason why they still kept on Android and made mandatory by its [CDD](https://source.android.com/compatibility/cdd) documentation. But the fact remains that if we add this sort of feature it'll trigger the Android app multitasking gesture (recents app switcher). There's a very tiny space left between the Fenix and Android gesture navigation pill (see the Screenshot¹) and **some (read a lot) Android OEMs hide that pill button altogether** (see the Screenshot²) making it even harder to not trigger the Android recents app switcher gesture instead of what this issue wants to trigger. So you either implement such gestures in 3 button Android layout or don't enable them on Gesture navigation layout. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if you still insist on adding this gesture then I'd say at least suggest to add a divider line between Fenix's address bar and the Android's gesture navigation pill bar so that it at least becomes easy to spot where the Fenix's address bar is or Fenix's window itself is ending and where the Android's gesture navigation pill bar is starting, so that users can correctly aim for the Fenix's address bar when it's at the bottom.

Add FAB onto Fenix's Home screen like Firefox Focus so users can easily open a new tab.

The FAB is currently inside the Tabs Tray screen.

Everyone!

The tabs tray will be more clean/clear without the FAB.

['feature request 🌟'],New tab + visit website UX,"## User Story
* As a user, I want to easily be able to visited a new website.

Currently I must

* tap open tabs (very top of phone)
* tap new tab (very bottom of phone)
* tap address bar (very top of phone)
* tap keyboard (very bottom of phone)
* tap suggestion (middle of phone)

This makes one handed use, or just any intuitive use more difficult.

Keeping all the UI for this very common action grouped as much as possible would help a lot.

Example 1

* tap open tabs (very top of phone)
* tap new tab, available as always the top on the tab list (top of phone)
* auto select address bar (without suggestions) keeping the collections/recommendations in the middle
* tap keyboard (very bottom of phone)
* tap suggestion (middle of phone)

This goes from 5 taps to 4 taps. And means I can do actions as top of phone, the bottom of phone. Instead of moving between the extremes with every action.

Example 2

* `+` tab icon, along side tabs icon
* auto select address bar
* tap keyboard
* tap suggestion

From 4 taps, to 3 taps.

Currently, the navigation bar has a solid background and is not transparent.  I suggest that the navigation bar should be transparent in order to display more content on the screen and provide a cleaner aesthetic.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
This problem exists, and its impact on content visibility can be seen below.  This is important as content that can be displayed effectively should not be hidden under a bar.

### Who will benefit from it?
This is especially important for the increasing amount of users who are using Android 10 gesture navigation as the current solid background is unappealing.

1. Enable ""Open links in app"" in Fenix settings

### Expected behavior
Fenix opens native app after clicking on link.

### Actual behavior
Fenix opens a new tab, with ""302 Moved Permanently"" text, and then opens native app.

### Device information

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Tabs']",Tab View: Buttons too far up,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
What I liked most about the new Fenix was the fact that all buttons are at the bottom of the screen and easily accessible.
With the new tab view this is unfortunately no longer the case.
The buttons for the private tabs and the menu are too high when you have some tabs open.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
It is important because the screens are getting bigger and bigger.

### Who will benefit from it?
Anyone who has a smartphone with a large screen.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:SendTab']",Automatically open sent tabs,"### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
Tabs sent to the device should be automatically opened in the tab list rather than popping up a notification which you then have to interact with.  The current behaviour runs counter to how the desktop version works where tabs are added automatically.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
It's important for ease of use.  As #11805 notes it can be annoying when you've sent a lot of tabs and have to click through them all to open them.  However, where that bug could be solved by making a single notification for all sent tabs, what I am proposing does away with the unnecessary user interaction.  After all you already knowingly sent Fenix the tabs.

### Who will benefit from it?
People that regularly send tabs between devices.  It also would have an additional effect of working between the various release channels as currently the notification opens in the default browser which may not be the browser you intended the tab to be sent to.

"['feature request 🌟', 'Feature:Tabs']","[Request] Add an empty search bar to the Tab Tray, allowing the creation of new tabs","The design flow with the tab tray is a little hard to parse through and really slows down my (and others) browsing. There's one main thing I'd like to suggest to make the tab tray more efficient and speed up browsing.

Currently, it takes 3 taps to create a new tab. First you need to get to the tab tray, then you need to go to home by clicking the '**+*_' button and then click on the search bar. While not the worst sequence it_ _is_

* confusing, especially with the ""Home button"" for the app being something that looks like it would create a new tab, but instead takes you to the location _where_ you make new tabs.

Instead of the tab tray _covering_ the address bar, have it pull up a search bar instead. 

![tab screen flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28973978/86558555-4faf4780-bf1f-11ea-8828-9416ff0624c6.png)

It will give very quick access to both creating new tabs, while also making the ""Home"" page feel more like a tool and less like a pitstop. While the other suggestions would be nice, _my biggest concern here is the ease of access to creating new tabs_. This does just that!

Let me know your thoughts.

"['feature request 🌟', 'eng:ready', 'Feature:Gesture']",Swipe left/right on site to go backward/forward in tab history,"### Edit: Roadmap for what needs to be done
* Needs GeckoView work (likely would have the same issues as pull-to-refresh if implemented now)
  * [ ] If Android provides 2-button or 3-button navigation, only then should we implement our own custom swipe-to-navigate

Broken out from #176 

### What is the user problem or growth opportunity you want to see solved?
There is no gesture to go back and forward in a tab's history. Going back requires pressing the back button and going forward requires opening the three dot menu.

One solution is to add a gesture to swipe left/right on a site to navigate backward/forward in tab history.

### How do you know that this problem exists today? Why is this important?
Currently, going back and forward in a tab's history requires moving your finger down to the toolbar or navigation bar. Android 10 gestures reduce the movement for going back, but not everyone has gesture navigation enabled.

IIRC, Safari on iOS has this gesture. Desktop browsers often allow a two-finger swipe on a touchpad to perform these actions.

Firefox on Mac:

### Who will benefit from it?
People who use gestures to navigate, especially on larger devices.

P.S.  To be really honest until now I always thought that Fenix did this but after trying to get the screenshots for filing this issue I realized that it isn't the case. I thought that only in this issue  https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/11107 the file size is not being shown but after seeing it now I realized Fenix doesn't do this; it doesn't show file size at all; it only shows a progress bar and a percentage in the notification. It really caused a lot of confusion between me and the developers, wait, actually it was just me who was confused. Sorry... :grinning:
This confusion caused because I mostly use external third-party download managers, so I download files very rarely with Fenix. I always thought that how could Fenix be missing such an useful feature. Or so...

The default ""Open links in apps"" should be off.  Can you please confirm?\r\n\r\nYes, I will definitely continue to work on this.

I already knew it but got confused by seeing the screenshots on this issue. Thanks for clearing the confusion. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**But**, Here\'s what this issue\'s reporter is saying: In Chrome browser\'s private browsing mode, lets say, for example, I searched for a laptop on Google search by typing ""Asus laptop Amazon"" then it\'ll bring me the search results, then I click one of the search results and now Chrome is opening that link in the browser itself and letting the user browser on Amazon website. \r\nNote: I have the Amazon app installed.\r\n\r\nbut in Fenix that link gets redirected and gets prompted to open the link in the installed  app when in private browsing mode and if I press on ""Cancel"" button the site stops loading and I have to load that link by going to 3-dot menu and clicking ""reload"" icon. And then I can browse the Amazon website in the Fenix itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this behavior can be improved by letting the website automatically reload and open that link in the browser itself if the user clicks on the ""Cancel"" button or we can make the behavior just like Chrome browser. **Or** we can let the user decide by letting them long press on the link and open that link in the new tab where the link doesn\'t open in the app and instead gets directly loaded and opened in the browser itself without any prompts. This is how Chrome browser handles links when the links are opened by long pressing them and opening them in the new tab both in normal and Incognito browsing mode. This would also make the ""open links in app"" more flexible and will provide users with more choice if they want to open some links in the browser itself rather than letting Fenix open all the links open in app when the ""open link in apps"" is enabled. Do you think I should open a new issue asking this feature?\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what do you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit:** #12626 & #12624 I have gone ahead and opened these 2 issues related to the suggestions I made. Let me know what you think about them. \r\n\r\n@rocketsroger Please let me know if I  should open new issues for -- if we should make the behaviour like Chrome Browser when the user is in the Private Browsing Mode. I have seen Chrome browser opens most of the links when in the incognito mode in the browser itself. But I have also seen it promt me to open links in apps occasionally. Or what issue #12388 is asking will suffice. \r\n\r\nWaiting for your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n Thank you. :)'}, {'user': 'Roger Yang', 'user_id': 6579541, 'user_site_admin': False, 'body': '> **Edit:** #12626 & #12624 I have gone ahead and opened these 2 issues related to the suggestions I made.

I understand that this functionality is very central to most users and it should provide privacy protection as well as convenience.
